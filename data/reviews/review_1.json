THis is a newer hotel, but there is no service elevator. I was continually surprised after waiting for an elevator at how many stops we made for housekeeping to enter with carts, room service carts and trays, etc. How could Hyatt skip a service elevator on this new property? It really stinks at times.....its bad.\nLastly, i have traveled with world and certainly know NYC pricing. Breakfast at the Andaz ranks above almost anything i have ever paid. Apparently, i had a $190.00 breakfast for two the first morning, and $175.00 the second. Eggs for each, coffee, berries. Wow. Of course, i really don't know...as there is no bill. They just deliver it, and leave. Prices are listed in the in-suite menu, but no itemized billing is given. I am 'gifted' with a $75.00 credit for my breakfast as a Diamond member, and i assumed that had not been applied when my bill reflected a 'non itemized' charge for $110 plus for the first night, and slightly less for the second. I was wrong, it had been applied (no way for me to see this). WOW. It certainly isn't worth it.\nI know i sound like one of those guys who complains about pricing, but clearly doesn't know what things cost. Wrong. This one really surprised me, and i have traveled the world for more than 20 years staying in some of the finest hotels in the world.

Viand diner downstairs was OK for dinner -- not great but sufficient. Friendly front desk folks were really helpful -- have breakfast at Bagel Talk not too far away. Very convenient to American Museum of Natural History -- easy to catch a cab or subway.

Went with my adult daughter and we stayed in a corner room with two twin beds on the ninth floor. It's tough to find good hotels with two beds in a room in NYC so this was a bonus. The room was very quiet. I could not hear anyone from other rooms, the hallway or any street noise. The room has a sleek modern design and was spacious for NYC standards. I loved the bathroom. Being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was great and snacks in the rooms was a nice touch.\nI also loved the overall vibe of the hotel; small, hip, clean, and friendly. Great artwork. Not warm and cozy though. The seating in the \"lobby\" is not particularly comfortable or inviting. The staff was young and not as experienced as one would find at a five-star hotel but this is not a five-star hotel. They did the best they could to help with restaurant reservations, shopping information and other general information. Easy walk from here to Grand Central Station to hop the subway and cabs easy to find. Loved being across from The New York Pubic Library and Bryant Park. Lovely pop-up stores and ice skating in Bryant Park for the holidays. Beats the craziness of Rockefeller Center in my book. \nThere are a few problems that I believe can be corrected easily. One is the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. It is very dark and would be really difficult if you were trying to get ready for a special event. Also there is no drawer space and the closet is minuscule. Not sure how to correct that issue. The other problem is that the beds, at least the twins we slept in, were not very comfortable. Very firm which is fine if you like it that way.

For some reason it was just a better experience than the restaurant.\n* Do use the concierge for tickets, restaurant and visitor recommendations. Everything they suggested worked perfectly and they enhanced our stay hugely.\n* Don't be afraid to walk and when I say walk I mean stroll. Take your time, look around and you'll be surprised how easy it is to get to places on foot. Empire State Building is insanely close by, Madison Square Garden a short walk beyond that. Rockerfeller Center, Broadway and Times Square make an easy and fun circular route and you can stroll up 5th Avenue to Central Park and beyond quite easily.\n* Subways are a nightmare to find if you're used to the clear signposting in London or Paris but once you done it once or twice you'll get the hang of it. The Setai is no more than a block or two in any direction from the subway.\n* Taxis are a law unto themselves.

A stranger did it for me! Once checked in, an employee decided to show me to the room with me trailing along with my luggage and holding the door to the elevator for him. I finally told him to take the luggage. Once in the room I was told that I was not allowed to adjust the temperature of the room on the thermostat. When I asked about the window heating/AC unit, he proceeded to fiddle with it. I told him to be sure that it was off. He lied and said it was off. It was not off. I later had to get the engineer to turn it completely off as the prior employee had activated a timer that was cycling it on and off. There is no lighting in the closet or for that whole end of the room where I was attempting to unpack. I took the minimum out of my bag for fear of losing the other things in the dark. All wall plugs are completely filled with the hotel's stuff. I had to get down on my hands and knees to find a strip plug underneath the desk for my IPad to charge. Then I found an outlet on the side of the desk for my IPhone to charge. However, to my dismay the next morning I found that when I turned off the desk light, the desk plug also went dead and my phone did NOT charge overnight. The mattress was good and that is why this hotel received three stars instead of two. Now, the shower: I scalded my right arm turning off the shower because there are absolutely NO markings on the shower as where hot, cold or off is. I recommend that you step outside the tub/shower before turning it off and be sure not to have any part of you under the water when turning it off. There is no ventilation in the bathroom. Therefore, not only was the bathroom completely steamed, which ruined my hair, but also the bedroom windows. As to the so-called BAY window in my room: The top half of the windows is completely blacked out by the hotel eliminating half the light coming in the windows. And this room really needs more light. In addition, there are dark brown wooden shutters that cannot be lifted, only tilted that further curtail light entering this room. What a dismal swamp it is. Breakfast: there was an argument about whether or not I was allowed to order the continental breakfast, being first told no and later told yes. And then there was the issue with the eggs. Even when I told them how many minutes to boil the eggs, the cook could not do the eggs even half way cooked to wear I asked. Not a good situation, in my opinion. Sleeping: Although the mattress was comfortable, I had to wear earplugs and play a sound soother to sleep well. When the neighboring room turned on its shower, the water sound screamed and bubbled right at the headboard to my bed. I checked out in the AM for a conference, stored my luggage at the hotel and was allowed to use the gym in the late PM to change my shoes for my trip home in the early evening. I am attempting to be fair and point out the good, too. And finally, when I noted some of the deficiencies to the person who originally escorted me to my room his answer was: \"It is What it is.\" Now that I am safely at home, I can laugh at this most ridiculous interpretation of customer service I have ever heard.", "author": {"username": "9Adventuress", "num_cities": 9, "num_helpful_votes": 26, "num_reviews": 20, "num_type_reviews": 13, "id": "212787FEB4E7A223D38277943BCA6E55", "location": "Cockeysville, Maryland"}, "date_stayed": "December 2012", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "December 7, 2012", "id": 146977843, "via_mobile": false}

They recognized us each time we walked in and out, which made things really great.

Ours had 2 queen beds and not much room for anything else. The one negative was that it was rather dimly lit even when we turned on every last light, but from what I understand this is a green hotel and they are saving on energy and wattage. However, we would have liked to have the room a bit brighter since there was also a lot of woodwork and dark closet doors which also made the room on the dark side even during the day. The beds were extremely comfortable with nice white fluffy duvet comforters and down pillows. There were a lot of outlets and close to the bed (and located on the nightstands) which were great for charging phones and computers.\nWe were on a high floor with nice views. The rooms with two beds don't face the empire state building, which was a bummer because we hoped to see it from the windows.

Our suite, #1000, had the most amazing view of Rockefeller Centre. Also, the windows open nice and wide, which was good because the hotel has that stuffy old hotel air, which gives it its charm but also makes it hard to sleep at night. Of course opening the window makes it louder than normal; I brought earplugs.

When your on a quick 4 day'er, you don't spend any time in it anyway. It had a TV, dresser draws, a little fridge, a good sized bathtub shower and a desk with chair. Pretty standard. \nUnfortunately, we did not eat in the hotel restaurant but a lady in the elevator told me that it was great. Within a 5 block radius there are plenty of restaurants and Irish Pubs (which happen to be my favourite!), so the hotel ammendities were not that important to me on this trip. There is a good, reasonably priced, family style restaurant at the end of the block called \"the red flame\". Great breakfast diner restaurant for it's price. \nAs I mentioned, the hotel is close to everything. Don't kid yourself though, if you are in New York to see the sights, you will be walking alot.

And the reality two non sparkling bottles of water. If I wanted to have some coke it was necessary to use room service. It was not overpriced but still very annoying. And the promise given has not been fulfilled.\nThe other negative aspect was that we were not provided with advantages as LHW members except for thenice personal letter from the manager. Usually we receive at least some fruits, uograde, free internet or something...\nThe last negative point was about pre arrival assistance and concierge. We sent some requirements before our arrival but got answer only very late as our email was categorized as spam and the concierge had not chcecked the spam folder. We also had some difficulties with our reservation when in the city and were not able to reach the concierge via phone. We succeeded only after 15 minutes and sixth call. \nOne great tip about the hotel: no checkout time limit. Pretty good!\nDespite small negative issues we very much enjoyed the stay and can honestly recommend the hotel to others.", "author": {"username": "CzechTourist", "num_cities": 23, "num_helpful_votes": 19, "num_reviews": 27, "num_type_reviews": 23, "id": "93204D751F8796489DB9807AE98C2979", "location": "Prague, the Czech Republic"}, "date_stayed": "October 2012", "offering_id": 1776857, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "December 4, 2012", "id": 146744546, "via_mobile": false}

We stayed an unfortunate four nights at this hotel, and suffered major itching, including a major let down from what we were advised BEFORE booking at The Chatwal! We phoned prior to booking to ensure that the hotel had bathtubs (as our personal preference, we only book with hotels which have bathtubs) - we were advised that EVERY room has a bathtub - excellent, so we booked. We arrived all the way from New Zealand (19 hours of flight-time) at approximately 11:00pm to arrive to a major disappointment. NO BATHTUB! We phoned the desk from our room and were advised \"sorry, there's nothing we can do as all rooms with a bathtub are taken\". We then advised that prior to booking we were advised that ALL ROOMS have a bathtub - \"no sorry, you were told wrong, and there's nothing I can do but you are welcome to leave\". Then my husband went downstairs and spoke to the \"duty manager\" who then finally relented and looked up to see who would be checking out the following morning so we could get a room with a bathtub. We were then promised a room with a bathtub by 12:00 midday, but by the next morning, the woman at the desk advised \"sorry, but they are now checking out at 4:00pm\", so we asked for a refund for the first day since the whole inconvenience had ruined a whole entire travel day (WE had been trying to sort out this mess OURSELVES all night long and the following morning by arranging a room with a bathtub) - their reply \"sorry, there's nothing I can do\" - she didn't even offer any complimentary gestures as a way of saying sorry for the inconvenience caused by this ridiculous hotel! We would have loved to have checked out and moved to another hotel, however, upon such short notice and only arranging three days in New York, time was very restricted. This hotel is PERFECT FOR BACKPACKERS WHO HAVE MONEY! The hotel is so small and running on a strictly cheap budget that there is no doorman in the morning upon check-out.

When getting out of the taxi, we had our bags taken care of right away and directed towards the check in counter. We had no problems at check in, and received a complimentary room upgrade which was a pleasant surprise.

Leather closet doors that looked like trunks, an excellent bar area, and a comfortable big bed. The bathroom is amazing. While there was no bathtub, the shower made up for it as it was very large, and the toilet was quite neat with all these japanese style options. The amenities provided were also excellent.\nWe also used the butler service to have our shoes shined, and clothes pressed before dinner.\nHad a chance to use the pool, and gym facilities, which were adequate, but they were working with the space they had.\nThe location was very close to Times Square, so that was convenient, but isolated so the noise and traffic would not affect your stay.\nOur four night stay was quite pleasant, however you get what you pay for, and the Chatwal is pricey.

We used our Starwood points for the room. Little pricey, but it's a nifty hotel. The lobby area is small, but with gorgeous Art Deco. Interior of The Lambs Club restaurant is also really lovely. It's right off Times Square, so location is good for most things.\nRooms at the Chatwal aren't super big, but this is NYC and this is a retro location, so I didn't expect massive space. What they lack in size, they make up for in appointments. The rooms are done up kind of like I'd imagine a 1920s cruise ship. Leather doors with leather handles, kind of like old time steamer trunks. Lots of cubbies and efficient use of space. Cool bar. Bathrooms are awesome. As others have mentioned, the toilets have an unreal number of functions--bidet, seat warmer, air dry. Too many functions, really, but fun when you're on vacation.\nOur room was facing the alley, so nothing great on the view. But the room was nice enough that it didn't matter. Wish the bed had been a bit more comfy and higher off the floor--all the beds seemed very, very low--but overall I was pretty happy with the space. Service was great as well. Free shoe shine and you have a butler who can handle things like pressing your suit or dress for dinner.\nDid have a bad situation, which highlights the excellence of the service. We'd been given a room with a connecting door. Unfortunately, next door were three single guys having a weekend in the city and the noise was unreal. Like they were standing right next to you talking in your ear while you were trying to sleep. So we got to participate when they got room service at 2 a.m. when they got up at 8:30 and then again when the maids came in to clean at 9. After the first night, we complained to the desk and they gave us a new room.\nWe went out for the day and when we came back, they'd packed all of our things and moved them for us. And they were thorough--they even found the charger my husband had left plugged into the wall. So have to give them credit for the assist.\nThat said, if you walk into your room and there's a connecting door and you're not with the people staying in the next room, immediately get a new one. You will hear everything.\nOverall I enjoyed it. Honestly, I was probably expecting a little more for the level, so I wouldn't say it exceeded my expectations, but it was very nice. My gold status didn't really get us much of anything, so can't say Starwood helped much, other than to use the points. It's not inexpensive. It was 30,000 points plus per night, and more than $700 if we'd paid out of pocket. Not out of sync for this level in NYC, but the St. Regis was on the same point level and I can't say I think it's better than that. \nBottom line--if you're looking for something retro and cool, it's great. If you need something more modern or a lot of space, probably not for you.", "author": {"username": "dagnyt", "num_cities": 10, "num_helpful_votes": 43, "num_reviews": 15, "num_type_reviews": 12, "id": "2460DAC350A498A3DB494E1FE485F32C", "location": "Tallahassee, Florida"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 1641016, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "November 20, 2012", "id": 145838274, "via_mobile": false}

We had just come from two weeks at The Greenwich Hotel in Tribeca which was fantastic.\nThe ONLY reason this did not get a poorer rating is that the building is in a convenient location, this was a reason we choose not to move. You are right opposite Central Park with the horse and carriages and in short walking distance to all the main Fifth Avenue shops. Other positives were; spacious bedroom, heaps of wardrobe space, free wifi, free sodas that were refilled every day, comfy bed, plenty of bathroom amenities, choice of newspaper, heaps of TV channels and a coffee machine. Godiva chocolates were placed on our pillow at night, which you do not see often nowadays. There were a lot of old world touches.\nRather than give you two weeks of examples of the poor service we received, I will list just a few, remembering we are paying $700+ per night, it was $635 and then you add all the taxes. Before I start with the negatives, the reason for my heading is that Sherry lacks a lot of services that a hotel has, for example, there is no lounge to go sit in, read and watch the world go by. There is no casual area to have a coffee or snack, just a small lobby with a couple of chairs so if you are staying here for any length of time, you are stuck in your room. There is no pool to go sit by. A previous reviewer stated that their stay was \u201codd\u201d and now I understand why. For two weeks I was able to watch how the staff treat the hotel guests versus the residents of the building and it is very different, in fact, we felt like we were imposing and intruding, we did not feel like hotel guests. The concierge\u2019s were polite but they had this underlying tone and attitude. \nSo we arrive at the Sherry and are greeted by Alvin who collects our bags. We are checked in by the concierge and given a nice welcome until she looks at my passport photo and tells me how much I have aged. Now I just laughed it off, however upon reflection, this lady did not know me and is that appropriate behaviour from a five star hotel? Or maybe it is not a five star hotel, it is a residential building and she became too familiar with us?\nAlvin takes us up to our room and we step out to renovations occurring on the second floor, which is where our room is. The concierge forgot to inform us of this when checking in. Alvin points out that the Business Centre is closed for renovation and lucky for us they have relocated it right next door to our room. Alvin shows us our room, we tip him and he stated that he is a native New Yorker and if we need anything he is around \u2013 we never saw Alvin again until check out two weeks later when he picked up our bags. There was a box of Godiva chocolates and flowers welcoming us. There were also two notes from the management. Both notes had different and incorrect spellings of my name. My booking was made by my travel agent so they had all the details \u2013 oh and my surname, only has four letters and my Christian name is also very easy. \nI wondered about the renovations going on but at that time (it was about 3pm in the afternoon on a weekday) we could not hear any noise, so unpacked and settled in. We were happy. In fact, during the whole two week stay we did not actually hear much of the renovation going on, it is what woke us up each morning. As stated above, there was board on the floor in the hall way stuck together by masking tape. Each night it was removed and every morning (weekday) it was re-laid. So between 8.00 \u2013 8.30am you would hear the ripping of masking tape and while doing this the person laying the board would have a very loud conversation with the housekeeping staff or other tradesmen, right near our room. So rather than wake up naturally, without fail we were woken by the staff of the \u201chotel\u201d. There were mornings on the weekend when I woke up to the housekeeping staff calling out to bring more towels or for a staff member calling for security on her walkie talkie. My tip to the Sherry, if your guest has the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign up and the paper is still outside their door it indicates they are still asleep.\nThe bathroom \u2013 it was small. However, we had a bath, great I thought! Then I looked at the bottom of it, the non-slip surface was fifty shades of grey, there was no way I was sitting on that. It needed to be replaced or given a damn good bleach.\nThis leads me into housekeeping, extremely inconsistent. If a hotel is renovating and it expects its guests to stay within the area during this phase then the housekeeping needs to be vigilant with keeping building dust to a minimum. After about four days I noticed the build up of dust. It is important to note here that there was a lot of drawers and wardrobe space so we did not leave a lot of personal items out on the side cabinets or tables. The housekeeping did not have to move any personal items to dust. By day five I was able to write words into the dust, I wrote \u201chello\u201d on the TV stand and it still did not get cleaned. Day seven it did, only because I happened to be in the room at the time. I am not sure if the bathroom got cleaned, as there was a pubic hair on the daddo by the toilet and stayed there for the full two weeks with all the dust.\nNow there are plenty more examples to provide but the piece de resistance was room service. We had been eating in a lot of restaurants and decided to stay in one night. I said to my husband all I feel like is a toasted cheese sandwich. He rings room service and orders one each. We get our order \u2013 two plates with covers. First thing we notice, only one glass of water, we laugh. Then we lift the lid and were shocked. The toasted sandwich was that, a cheese toasted sandwich. Not what you expect from a five star kitchen: there was no parsley for decoration, no fries, no salad just plain crappy white bread with plastic cheese and the crusts cut off and it was very dry (took a photo of it). Now you are probably saying, yeah, that is what you wanted. Yes but guess what we paid when I asked my husband what the amount was on the bill - $41.00 for two toasted sandwiches and one glass of water. I would not have minded if we got some fries and salad with that. In all my travels and I have been travelling most of my life that would go down as the worst hotel dish I have seen and the biggest RIP OFF! By the way, based on this dish we did not even want to waste our time and money going to the restaurant. \nMy tip if you are staying at the Sherry, go around corner to the deli we got beautiful sushi (spicy crab) for $5.75. Also for the international visitors who may not know, you can take your washing to a dry cleaner and they do it for you, usually one pound of clothing costs about $1.00. We had 44 items of clothing washed and it cost $20.\nBY the way I was happy to put all of this into a customer satisfaction feedback form but there was not one in our room. So with this experience in mind, go to a proper hotel, a place that provides the amenities a hotel of five star standard should. We certainly noticed the difference when we checked in at the Peninsula in Beverly Hills after staying at the Sherry \u2013 now there is a hotel!

Apparently on the pent house floor there are also hospitality suites directly across the hall from the guest suites. By design this is a very poor choice by the hotel as hospitality suites are typically for parties. Yes, we were staying across the hall from a loud drunken open house party! The music was loud, the people were in and out of the suite causing a big disturbance in our suite. A note was slipped under our door by the Party Hostess suggesting that she knew it was loud and that we should join them. This is not at all what we had in mind for our wedding night. At 12:30am when we couldn't take anymore we checked out and found another hotel. The attendant at the front desk was considerate and understanding as we conveyed the issues and didn't charge us for the room. I can only think that the rental price for the Hospitality Suite was much more than our guest suite as no additional solutions to the problem were offered. The whole experience was frustrating.

After much searching with AmEx emergency services (Great job from them as well), The Eventi showed up as the only practical option.\nI travel frequently and I often stay at Kimpton properties because I like their unique designs. I am low-maintenance when I'm on the road and it is rare that the performance of the staff has any significant impact on my stay. After a harrowing five days of urban camping in my powerless and waterless apartment, the Eventi staff took us all in like family, and made the world seem safe and normal again.\nPatrick, Gabriella , and I wish I could remember everyone's names, but suffice it to say that the entire desk and valet staff were phenomenal. Robert, the GM, has pulled together a special group of people. They greeted us warmly and played with our dogs. The next morning, staff that we hadn't even met knew the names of the animals and would greet them by name when I took them out for walks. They offered treats. They even remebered that one dog likes her head scratched and the other one likes his butt scratched. They helped us with dry cleaning and laundry. The housekeeping staff were excellent and had the room spotlessly clean every day - even the fur was gone. When I had to bring a cat from my apartment because she was ill, a filled litter pan and a small bag of cat food was waiting outside the room door when I returned (I never even thought to ask for one). Our menagerie ended up staying for eight days until we confirmed that we would not be able to return to our apartment for several months, and we relocated out of State to stay with family. One night, I was bringing back pizza to eat in the room (from Waldie's - an excellent pie). The doorman saw the box and said \"Aha! You discovered Waldie's. Their pizza is fantastic\". A few minutes later, we were all sharing the pizza in the lobby and laughing and telling stories around the front desk like we had all been friends since college.\nAs for the room: Beautiful. Quite subdued by Kimpton standards, with lots of dark wood and chocolate tones. Very contemporary and elegant. Terrific bed, sheets and pillows.

The hotel and room were meticulously clean and well maintained, which is always my first priority. Location is great, close to subway stops and walking distance to Penn station. Location is of course subjective in NYC, depending on where you need to be.\nWe stayed in a city-view king on the 18th floor. Spectacular views, our room faced east so we had an excellent view of the Empire State Building. Road noise was reasonable during the day and practically non-existent at night with the blinds drawn. HVAC noise was of course present but within a reasonable level. Room was perfectly clean, great condition, and quite sizable by city standards. Bathroom was spacious, modern and functional. My only complaint with the entire property was with the bed. I prefer a really firm mattress and this one was a bit soft for my liking. Actually seemed like the topper could use replacing. That being said we slept fine, pillows and linens were nice.\nWe ate breakfast and dinner in the restaurant and the food was very good. Culinary choices are plentiful in NYC but it\u2019s nice to know that you can also get quality food without leaving the hotel. There\u2019s also a free wine hour in the late afternoon which my wife took advantage of, she commented that it was a great opportunity to meet other travelers.\nThe staff were friendly and attentive. We arrived at around 11AM expecting to just drop off our luggage but they had a room available so we were able to check in immediately. The day we checked out it was raining so I asked the staff were I could get an umbrella. They said we could use the one from the room, even though we were checking out, and to just return it before we left the city. These are just little things that make the stay more enjoyable.\nGreat hotel, great stay, would highly recommend.", "author": {"username": "Jeff128", "num_cities": 3, "num_helpful_votes": 4, "num_reviews": 3, "num_type_reviews": 3, "id": "D1B05304E01C2916FDAC1141CA2C93B3", "location": "Albany, New York"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 1456560, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "December 3, 2012", "id": 146699142, "via_mobile": false}

Setting this trip in context, we are the parents of a profoundly learning disabled son and we had to negotiate and save our respite care for a year so that we could have our first holiday alone since our honeymoon. This was to be the most luxurious,spoilt treat of our lifetime.\nIn April, we booked the Suite Surrender package staying in an Empire State Suite. The package at that time was similar to the one currently on offer which promised:\n\u2022 The attention of a Personal Assistant, a signature service provided by Capella Hotels and Resorts\n\u2022 A couture kitchen filled with New York City\u2019s finest flavors, stocked once and entirely prior to your arrival\n\u2022 Complimentary refreshment center \n\u2022 A bottle of Taittinger Ros\u00e9 champagne and fresh fruit upon arrival\n\u2022 a $100 Auriga credit per night for treatments in-suite or in the luxurious Auriga spa. \n\u2022 Complimentary pressing of up to 5 items and shoe shine on the date of your arrival\nUnlike the current offer, we were not promised the Bergdorf Goodman voucher but instead a luxury breakfast delivered daily to our suite. \nI specified that I wanted a room on as high a floor as possible and emphasised that this was a special occasion.\nWe were waiting for the call from our personal assistant prior to our arrival, but the call didn't come.\nOn arrival at the hotel, the door men did not open the door as we struggled through with our luggage and with only one member of staff on duty at reception joined the line to check in. Things started to look up when we were told we had been upgraded as this was a special occasion and we were allocated room 2702. Bizarrely,we were walked to the elevator and whilst in the elevator the promise of pressed clothes was explained -surely this should have been done at the reception desk? \nStill, we headed to our room, excited about our upgrade. This was an eagerly anticipated stay, so I had devoured the website and all of the photos, so when I entered the City one bedroom suite I was disappointed. This was NOT and upgrade but a DOWN grade. Although this suite was bigger in square footage, it was a cheaper suite. We looked for the bottle of champagne and fruit but there was none. We looked in the fridge for the finest flavours of NYC and found 6 small bottles of soda a bottle of water and four milk creamers for coffee.\nI was gutted.\ni phoned down to reception but no-one answered. I phoned the personal assistant line only to told it was nothing to do with them and I needed to contact reception. I explained I could not get through and asked if the city room was a lower grade room than an empire room, I was told by the personal assistant that it was a downgrade and she put me on hold and eventually through to reception. No apology was forthcoming for the poor service in fact I felt reprimanded for challenging the upgrade and was told that the suites had been renamed since I booked and that I indeed had an upgrade. Strange though that the same names are advertised currently on the website and that indeed, the empire suite is about $300 a night more expensive that our city room.\nThe receptionist said she would send up the missing elements of our package when it was checked out. We were by now exhausted, having been travelling for over 21 hours. We had just wanted to crack open the champagne, drink to our anniversary and get some rest. We waited over an hour for the delivery and then decided to get some sleep as the goods were clearly not coming. Half an hour into our sleep the door was persistently knocked. My husband had to get up, dress and answer the door to receive:\n the bottle of champagne\n the fresh fruit - this was in fact a small plate of sliced fruit salad.\n a wine glass with more fresh fruit salad and plain yoghurt\n a dish of nuts\n three one oz pieces of cheese on a tray\n a four pack of beer\n a four pack of root beer.\n~Sorry, but do these latter 4 items classify as New York's finest flavors? In a five star hotel, I was expecting a lot more. AND they did NOT stock the fridge, they barely filled one shelf.\nOn rising on Sunday 28th October, we headed to Ai Fiori with our complimentary breakfast vouchers. Again, we had been promised luxury breakfasts in our room, instead we were given 6 continental breakfast vouchers for a muffin, croissant and danish with orange juice and a coffeee. Hardly luxury. Even this was poorly served. We submitted our vouchers and then were billed $60. We finished our coffees and had to ask for a refill. My husband called over the waiter, he went for the coffee pot, then filled my husband's cup and walked away leaving my cup empty. Surely, a Michelin starred restaurant has heard of silver service?\nWe headed out into Manhattan. We would have loved at this point to have had our personal assistant organise a ride in the Maserati as we were heading to Tiffanys to get a ring to celebrate our occasion, but as for the entire duration of our stay, we were not allocated a personal assistant \"the signature service provided,\" therefore we did not get that opportunity.\nOn no occasion, did any member of staff apology for the lack of service or the failure to provide what was being paid for. All of these issues are basic customer care issues, a product was ordered and it was down to the staff of the Setai to deliver, but this was a total failure.\nSubsequent issues resulted from the skeleton staff in situ.\nWhen we arrived back in the hotel after our few hours in Manhattan, we picked up the letter stating that due to the imminent arrival of Hurricane Sandy, we would not have a housekeeping service. So we did not have any of the snacks delivered each afternoon that previous guests have raved about. We did not have any amenities replaced - i.e. soaps, and when we ran out of Nespresso capsules it took 3 requests and 9 hours before we had them delivered. We appreciate that staff were under pressure by this time, but we offered to collect the capsules from reception on two occasions and on each we were told they would be sent up to our room, without any apology. Ironically, they arrived 30 minutes before the power outage.\nOn Monday, we had no restaurant service and had to eat in the bar. In the evening, we were provided with a buffet dinner at a cost of $25 per person. Two choices of main course, one potato, one veg. Considering the conditions,$25 was taking advantage.\nBy Monday night, the power was out and so we were in darkness, no elevators (Essential on the 27th floor), no hot water in the morning and bread, cheese and ham for breakfast. \nIn summation, during our luxury break we had:\n A downgraded room - one bedroom suite instead of Empire state - which had been specifically requested\n No personal assistant service\n One turndown service\n No daily clean of suite for entire stay\n None of the promised surrender package (until minimum arrived after complaint)\n No breakfast in suite\n Use of the Nespresso machine for one out of three days (due to lack of capsules)\n One breakfast in Ai Fiori\n Power and hot water for two out of three nights.\nYet, we were billed the full amount for our stay of over $3400. We did mention the lack of the suite surrender package, specifically mentioning the lack of the spa vouchers and were cheekily told that we could have the vouchers. What use would they have been with the spa closed and the power out?\nWe were offered a 50% reduction on the cost of our final night - the one with no power, water or food, which we did take BUT we were greatly under stress by this point. We had just been told our flight was cancelled, our son was due home with noone to care for him and we had to find a hotel in a city where 9000 flights had been cancelled stranding many others in a similar situation. With hindsight, we were sold short. We should been paying the cost of a one bedroom suite -without the package, we should have had the $100 per night spa voucher returned along with $120 the apparent cost of the four breakfasts we did not get. Without basic housekeeping we should have received some compensation. Our lifetime holiday- an opportunity we will NEVER have again, was in ruins. Not due to Sandy, but due to uncaring, inhospitable staff. \nWe are very understanding of the difficult situation that staff were put in when NYC went into close down, but it needs to be stated that in our \"new\" hotel, the Westin Grand Central, we were made to feel very welcome, we were given free coffee when we arrived to check if they had room, they gave us free wifi for our entire stay to allow us to get in contact with home to make arrangements for our son and they had such a friendly outlook that staff in the Setai could learn from. \nThis was sent to the Setai management and a phonecall to discuss this has been promised, but as yet has not happened. It appears from subsequent reviews that our experience was not unique yet others seem to have a magical time.

They recommend a few local shops and food places if we wanted to pass the time.

I do not cope well with confined spaces etc but the speed of the lifts was excellent and I managed to survive the constant use! :). We arrived at our room and it appeared we had been given a larger room (possibly because I emailed in advance) and we also received a complimentary bottle of wine and box of chocolates which was a lovely touch. The room was excellent, large, spacious, very clean with more than enough storage. The views from our huge window were fantastic! The concierge were attentive and informative without being pushy (this was my partners 6th time in NYC and they did not feel the need to tell her anything as she had good local knowledge). \nEven though NYC pretty much shut down for a few days, the housekeeping service was still available (albeit on a reduced staff) and they were very polite. If you are there for a few nights (we were for 5) I would recommend that on your first morning to leave a $10 dollar tip and a note to housekeeping then leave $2/$3 for the duration of your stay and you will end up with plenty of extra toiletries/towels/pillows etc or anything else you may need. \nThe hotel staff kept all guests up to date with information regarding local facilities that were still available during the hurricane. \nWe were both very impressed with Hotel Beacon and the staff and will certainly be planning on staying there again when we visit again next year.

Tried putting AC on high for a while to change the air but it didn't do much of a difference. Other than that small inconvenience, bed clean, very comfortable and couldn't ask for anything else.

The hotel was pleasant enough, but a bit overrated in my opinion, mostly due to inconsistent service. My brother also happened to be staying at the hotel, using the same flash sale but for a longer stay, so we were able to compare our experiences. His room was actually directly above ours.\nFirst off, I would have to say this is not my favourite New York neighbourhood--5th Ave. between 36th and 37th. While such tourist sites as the Empire State Building, Macy's and Lord and Taylor are nearby, I prefer the sites and shops on or near 5th Ave. 15-25 blocks north-- Saks, Barneys, the Top of the Rock, MOMA. Bryant Park, the NY Public Library and the Morgan Library are also nearby. When we walked from the hotel toward Times Square to catch a play (\"The Heiress\"), we walked down a street (37th?) that had store after store of cheesy discount evening gowns.\nThe hotel itself is lovely, occupying the lower floors of a 57 story building designed by Gwathmey Siegel, who did the Guggenheim Museum's addition. This was one of Charles Gwathmey's last projects before his untimely passing. Perhaps most unique are the hotel's angular windows that open to let in a decent amount of fresh air. The lobby is more like a foyer, not really a space to sit and relax, but has some nice design touches, especially the curved stairway leading to the 2nd floor restaurant (A Fiori) and the pendulous teardrop-like sculpture in its centre. The Bar on Fifth, where one can sit and relax, is just beyond the lobby. The hotel has a flexible check-in/check-out policy, so when we arrived rather early after our red-eye flight, our room was ready. A very kind and friendly bellman escorted us to the room and remembered and acknowledged us whenever we passed by later on.\nOur room was a Standard Room, the lowliest of room categories. It was actually quite spacious by New York standards (420 sq. feet), with almost half the space occupied by the sumptuously appointed bathroom, leaving the bedroom area a bit cramped. The next room category up, the Superior room, has the same square footage but a larger bedroom and smaller bath. The room was sleekly designed in shades of brown and beige, with wood paneling. The view was a \"courtyard\" view of the backsides of buildings that faced 36th or 37th St.--there was actually a good amount of natural light, and the bathroom also had a window, All windows were floor to ceiling. The bath had a dual head shower (rain or hand-held) over the tub. \nWhat I liked:\nThe complimentary Nespresso machine and refreshment centre (minifridge with sodas and water--no minibar). The high definition TV. The aforementioned angular windows. The nicely designed door jam that is a refreshingly modern alternative to the standard chain and bolt. The bath toiletries. The large WC alcove.\nWhat was less impressive:\nThe highly touted Duxiana bed was low-slung--a box spring topped by what looked like a mattress topper but no mattress (A peek at the Duxiana website shows that this is in fact one of their bed's designs--the \"magic\" apparently is in the number of springs in the base. Yes, it was comfortable, but not out of this world). Only 2 king pillows--4 would have been nice. Only one hand towel and one face cloth, but 2 bath towels and 2 bath sheets. The WC alcove could have used a door. Our shower curtain was full-length, but the one in my brother's room was at least a foot short of the tub ledge, leaving a frightfully dangerous, slippery wet marble surface after showering--a lawsuit waiting to happen. The TV is not wall-mounted, but rather sits on top of the desk, usurping valuable space. There is free Wifi, but no one told me you needed a password. The closet in the Standard rooms are not full length. The bedside cordless phones are hard to operate. The desk phone has a large lighted screen than cannot be dimmed while sleeping. We did not receive morning newspaper delivery, nor did my brother on any day. My brother got cookies with turndown, we got water from the refreshment centre. After we had checked-in (early), we spent an hour or so in the room, during which time the housekeeping staff and others could clearly be heard going about their business. At least 3 people tried to enter the room, only one knocked (luckily we had the door jam engaged). We heard a lot of doors opening and closing--it turned out the room across the way from ours was being used as a housekeeping storage room. A stairway door was also nearby.\nOur package included breakfast (a set value to be used in the restaurant or in-room), which we took in the restaurant--quite nice. Interestingly, for some selections, one is not served potatoes, but always a small salad. We also had late night room service (club sandwiches)-- also quite nice, and again with salads instead of carbs. There is a spa and salon that occupies the 4th floor, but we did not try these services. The fitness centre is on the 3rd floor (although the elevators say its on the 4th), as is the business centre--2 small key-accessed rooms housing computers and printers.\nIf this hotel was situated in an area more suited to my likings, it would definitely be on the list of possible accommodations. Even now, I would consider a return visit, but the luxury hotel milieu in Manhattan is highly competitive and somewhat large, so the Setai must pay attention to every detail to stay in the game.", "author": {"username": "pillowsofwanderlust", "num_cities": 20, "num_helpful_votes": 231, "num_reviews": 57, "num_type_reviews": 49, "id": "3F88F8D4F220EFE6418ED0B22AAF03E6", "location": "Los Angeles CA"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 1776857, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "November 22, 2012", "id": 145940048, "via_mobile": false}

We stayed with what we knew and have not been dissappointed.\nThe executive floor was under renovation but this did not detract from our stay. We had a very comfortable room - twin queen beds, large work area, big bathroom, all the needed facilities - tea, coffee, iron, toiletries and safe. Ceramic cups would be better than the paper ones for the room though.\nThe staff made our stay this time round. The valet was great - parking to allow us to get situated etc.., Guest Services exceptional - quick, efficient and polite. Requests for fridge, bathrobe, unblocking toilet, toilet paper, towels and linen were all effectively handled and we did not feel like we were \"bothering\" them - to the contrary - \"we are happy to help to make sure your stay is memorable\". And this over Thanksgiving! We were also given free wifi as our Thankgiving gift. The first receptionist we dealt with was a bit iffie. Her supervisor corrected her deficiencies.\nParking at $30 per night is very expensive. We were transported by my daughter and did not need a car. However, casual parking for her was expensive at $8 per 2 hours. The hotel does offer a good shuttle service to downtown (Macy's etc) and will fetch you. This was really appreciated. \nWe will be back to see my daughter and husband and will stay here again if possible.", "author": {"username": "Rob N", "num_cities": 15, "num_helpful_votes": 36, "num_reviews": 31, "num_type_reviews": 15, "id": "8DBE6B92BDAB99A83D1F8DB8EA56C6AA", "location": "Johannesburg, South Africa"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 282699, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "November 25, 2012", "id": 146186982, "via_mobile": false}

The quality of materials in the room exceeds your typical Marriott room. Large LG flat screen TV, good carpets, good drapes, fixtures, etc. all of nice quality. Great 4 cup coffee maker.\nBathroom: Good size, nice granite counters, huge Jacuzzi tub, huge shower with the best water pressure I have ever experienced. Tub and shower were clean, but Jacuzzi was very hard to activate; a maintenance man showed us how to turn it on by repeatedly using shallow pushes to the start button. Also, several jets came off while using the tub. It\u2019s a nice feature but was not maintained. \nBed: Very good bed. \nHouskeeping: Average. We left a tip requested extra bath towels. Housekeeping took the tip but did not leave towels. \nRestaurants: We cannot recommend the hotel restaurant. We had the full breakfast buffet on Thanksgiving morning. Both the food and staff were sub-par. The buffet was not restocked, and we had to scavenge the dregs of what remained. Several core items were out of stock on the buffet including jam and fruit. The bacon was swimming in grease. We finally asked the staff to bring us fruit, and they did. However, the staff\u2019s attitude was lackadaisical at best. We even had to get up to get our own water after waiting an extended period of time.

And the valets were very knowledgeable about downtown and restaurants. Use caution at night downtown. There are many bums in this part of downtown. I worked nearby at Pennzoil Place (about 5 blocks away) in the late 90s, and never noticed bums during the day. But they are everywhere at night, even urinating in public.

The building is beautiful, I believe it was a bank at one time, and you can still see the old vault behind the reception area. There are various room configurations, so make sure you know what you are getting when you book. They have accessible rooms, which is great if you require this access, but not so great if you don\u2019t need it. There is no pool at this hotel, and they have no agreements with any local hotels for access to their pool. It would have been nice for a cool down after a hot day, but not a deal breaker, if you're there on business.\nI found my room to be clean and the furnishings in excellent condition. I had a corner room, so I had lots of windows and light. The ceilings are nice and high, which adds to the feeling of space. There is a large desk, and Wi-Fi is free, so it\u2019s great for business travelers. I had a very comfortable King bed in my room and the pillows were OK, but they did get a bit flat after a few hours, so I had to use two. \nThe TV reception was sketchy \u2013 most of the lower channels were all snow, and there were not too many to choose from.\nThe bathroom was huge! My bathroom had a large walk-in shower, but no tub. The water pressure was good, and I never ran out of hot water. There was a standard shower head and a rain shower fixture. A colleague was also staying at this hotel, and she had a tub in her bathroom, so it sounds like there are multiple bathroom configurations, too. Shampoo, conditioner and body wash are in a dispenser, and a bar of soap is included for the sink area. Good sized vanity, with lots of space for toiletries, and a lighted makeup mirror. You can get a hair dryer on request.\nI was here for a conference, and I found the hotel staff friendly and helpful, the room clean and well suited for my needs, and the location convenient for everything I needed to do. \nThere is a restaurant at the hotel - The Line & Lariat. It is a really nice restaurant, and the food is very good. Breakfast is great and the service at breakfast was exemplary. Lunch service is at the bar, and was also excellent. I had the crab cakes for lunch and they were really good.\nDiner service, however, leaves a lot to be desired. I was seated promptly by the hostess, who had a bright, beautiful smile, and served me my water right away. 15 minutes later, I had lots of time to peruse the small menu, but I still hadn\u2019t seen a server. While the menu is not large, it does have good variety, with some unusual dishes tossed in. The supervisor finally came over and took my order, apologizing for the waitress who was quite busy. I found this rather strange, as there was a large conference in town, and there were lots of attendees staying at the hotel. You would think they would have made sure their staffing levels were sufficient to properly serve guests. Anyway, I ordered the Bryan Farms chicken, which was delicious. About 15 minutes after my order was taken, my server walked by an introduced herself on the way by. No apology for the slow service, just her name (which I promptly forgot) and that she would take care of me for the rest of the evening. That was the last time I saw her. It took about 20 minutes for my food to arrive, not completely unreasonable, but I was never offered any bread, even though I saw bread baskets on most of the other tables. I was only drinking water, and I had to flag down a bus person and ask before I got my water refreshed. \nAfter dinner, I sat with an empty plate for about 10 minutes before my empty dishes were cleared, again by the supervisor. The supervisor left my table with my dishes, then remembered to return and ask me if I wanted to order desert \u2013 which I did. Serving tables was obviously not this guy\u2019s job, but I have to give him an A for effort \u2013 he really did try. I had some chocolate concoction which was really sweet and very yummy! I never did get a refill of my coffee, even though I sat with an empty cup for about 15 minutes. I finally gave up and got up to leave. I had to ask the hostess to get my bill so I could pay it as I never did see anyone at my table again so I could to ask for it. \nAll in all, food was great, service appears to be somewhat inconsistent.", "author": {"username": "DorisBH", "num_cities": 27, "num_helpful_votes": 24, "num_reviews": 63, "num_type_reviews": 19, "id": "EC5CCE0DCFEF25BCB2D3FE9290D83E4A", "location": "Airdrie, Canada"}, "date_stayed": "September 2012", "offering_id": 283873, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "November 24, 2012", "id": 146108400, "via_mobile": false}

When I called the desk, they couldn't tell me how to fix it, you got it, they'd send a maid up to check it out. All that, for a price that was above average. I have to say though, that the staff was this surreal type of friendly. Like they were programmed with the same friendly responses. Better than being yelled and smirked at I guess? To their defense, the woman who booked the room for me was very accommodating. She got permission for my 60 lb. dog to stay when they usually only accept dogs under 35lbs. Of course there was an additional charge, and restrictions, but was pleased she went the extra step to allow my dog. Nice property all-in-all if you are wanting something with more personality. Absolutely loved that they had a Texas rubber duck waiting for you in the bathroom with some great soaps. The rooms was very cozy and relaxing. The city view was beautiful. The location was great for downtown nightlife and there was a nice park/walking area two blocks away, which my dog loved. I'd stay there again.

I was attending a convention at the nearby George Brown Convention Center.\nThis was my second visit to Houston, and by and large I can see a huge difference. The area around the Convention Center has been cleaned up (and that includes the hotel location). They've planted a park with trees, flowers, a pond and even a tea house. So Houston is definitely moving beyond its image of being a city of heat, dust and ugly concrete. The walk from the hotel to the Convention Center is short, and crosses part of the new park, so overall it feels like being in the same complex. This is a great plus and Houston is a city that is very spread out and where you can easily lose a lot of time travelling, even to places that are supposedly close by.\nThe hotel is also well located for other attractions in Downtown Houston. The main shopping street is just some blocks away (but honestly speaking not all that interesting, so I wouldn't go there). There are a number of neat bars some of the back streets around the hotel so those are well worth popping into. Also around the corner is the Houston Pavillions, a collection of themed restaurants and music bars all in one building. So you'll have no trouble spending your free time when you're here. I also recommend taking a walk around some of the older parts of Houston which are roughly North and West of the hotel. Personally I was impressed by the different architectural and historical styles. Most recommendable is the Gulf Building (also called Morgan Chase Building) which is an architectural landmark (you can go on a tour). They also seem to be cleaning other parts of Houston up as there is quite a lot of building and renovation going on and much of the ugliness there used to be is gone. One down side, and this has definitely increased since last time I was in Houston, is the number of homeless people and beggars roaming the streets, carrying their belongings in big bags. You see them all day but they seems to get more at night. They aren't dangerous or aggressive but it's still a sorry and uncomfortable sight.\nAnother thing I can recommend is taking a ride on the Metro. Despite what it's name suggests this is not a traditional metro with tunnels but a streetcar that runs through the streets of Houston and is an interesting way to see different parts of the city, passing several major parks, green areas, universities and other points of interest, and is also a great venue for people watching.\nThe hotel is quite easy to find. The architecture is a bit nondescript, but difficult to miss nonetheless. The doors were opened for me by a doorman and the receptionist helped me immediately. Besides the hotels and bars I mentioned previously, the hotel has several bars/restaurants of its own. I later tried the one downstairs. Although it was very late at the time (I guess it must have been the early hours of the morning), I was surprised they could still get me something to eat. The choice of drinks was also surprisingly good for a hotel bar and the barman very professional and knowledgeable about it. It was a bit lacking in atmosphere though as most other people there were serious business types and they went to bed quite early.\nThe hotel has a gym and even an outdoor pool but I only had a quick look at those as I didn't have time for more. Especially the pool did look very inviting, so if I ever come back I'll try and spend some time there. My room was higher up. The view from the window was idionymous with what much of Houston is about. In the foreground a massive expanse of derelict land, temporarily used for car parking, further away some buildings that looked as if they were soon to be torn down. I later discovered there are many more places like these. This is the surreal contrast that typifies Houston: Fancy hotels and many modern skyscrapers that are the HQs of multinationals, and right next door derelict plots and ruined buildings. It makes me wonder how the economics of all that works, and why the people who own what must be very expensive land don't do anything with it. \nThe room itself was good but nothing extraordinary. The bed was comfortable though and everything was clean. I didn't check out the minibar, but the ice cubes were filled up every day. Despite being in the middle of Houston, the room was very quiet and I think i slept very well. The bathroom was very tastefully designed, with lots of patterned tiles emanating a warm feeling, making you want to spend a lot of time there.\nI think the rooms have free WiFi, but I didn't get around to testing that. \nAll in all, the hotel was very well run. The staff were good, the hotel was extremely clean and I can find no fault with any part of it. The interior decoration is on the whole tasteful and makes you feel at ease. The location is also good.", "author": {"username": "Andy M", "num_cities": 5, "num_helpful_votes": 15, "num_reviews": 8, "num_type_reviews": 3, "id": "13119ED019F28C84291FF50D2C4C5515", "location": "Zurich, Switzerland"}, "date_stayed": "May 2012", "offering_id": 98952, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "November 5, 2012", "id": 144590752, "via_mobile": false}

The problems I had with the hotel are the same problems many reviewers have noted, which concerns me since they don't appear to be being addressed. I'll start with the cons (problem areas): 1) Check-in in has major issues - I initially attempted to check in at 11 am, there was no room available so they took our bags and told us to come back. They said they would work on getting us a high room as I requested. I ended up getting a room on the 4th floor...not high in my book, but I'm assuming it is the highest they had available. Anyhow, they called at around 4 to let me know my room was ready. We came back in the early evening to check in and that is when things took a turn. Check in was chaotic despite the fact that there was only one other couple checking in at the same time. The young man asked us for our name, handed us our key and that was it. No description of the property or amenities, no maps or questions about why we were visiting, no introduction or mention of the concierge, no offer to help us with our bags, nothing. The whole ordeal was a bit cold and unprofessional. 2) The staff is very young and trendy, which fits the hotel vibe, and always smile, but there is just a warmth that is missing. There also seems to be a real lack of organization. The staff always seem to be running around, but not necessarily helping you when you need it. Out of the three days we were there, a staff member opened the front door for us 1 time. That is unacceptable when I am paying $400 a night. I highly recommend management start instituting stations that people must man at all times instead of running around frantically. A person at the front door at all times and a person at the check-in desk at all times is a must. 3) No closet space. The hotel is trendy, I get it and I've stayed at other hotels with similar concepts, but none with this little storage space. No drawers and only a tiny glass closet space to hang a few item and 4) the bed was ok, definitely not the comfiest I've ever slept in.\nPros: Room was very, very clean and the view of the public library was nice. The minibar in the room was a nice touch since it offered free snacks and non-alcoholic drinks. The room was quiet despite facing 5th avenue.

Second complaint, we needed cabs on several occasions, nobody offered to get us a cab at first, then I remembered this happened twice--after we stood outside for like 5 minutes, someone finally came to help us, but was either at the same time chatting with someone else, or really not trying as hard as I'd like to.

When we arrived, they unfortunately were closed due to heating problems caused by Hurricane Sandy so we had to go elsewhere for our first night. The staff on duty were very apologetic and assisted us in getting to another hotel.\nThankfully, we were able to return on day two, so spent the rest of our trip there. We had booked a Capella room and asked for a high floor. We stayed in room 1401 which was massive......and I mean huge! The bed was six foot wide and was lost in the room. We overlooked Fifth Avenue and the Chrysler Building. The room had a decent sized seating area with a sofa and two armchairs and the bed. There was a dressing room which had two double open wardrobes and drawers. This then lead into a huge marble bathroom, with twin basins and plenty of countertop space. Shower was vast with two shower heads. You honestly have to see this room to appreciate the space. I do not like small hotel rooms and hate when your cases sit in the corner on open view, which serves to remind that you are going home.....no issues here though - suitcases were well hidden from view.\nThe Bar on Fifth has a nice, relaxed atmosphere and has jazz bands playing every night.\nLocation of the hotel is great for going to the various sights of NYC in both lower and midtown Manhattan.\nHad a serious personal issue during stay. Brian Fahey, Concierge Manager, was absolutely fabulous with his assistance. He always made sure that he kept up to date with the situation and it helped me feel a little more relaxed. \nManaged to use the hotel car (a Maserati) a couple of times - nice touch of luxury.\nOur room was right next to the lift shaft but we could not hear any noises. The room is at the end of the corridor with one other room and is a fair distance away from other rooms, so no disruptions from others walking past.\nDid not eat in the hotel (apart from room service late one night, which was good). Plenty of coffee shops, etc nearby for breakfasts.\nThe Nespresso machine and complimentary mini bar (soft beverages) was a nice touch. Have been in plenty of high end hotels which did not have this. There have been some previous comments bout these not being replenished when used but a quick call to Guest Services soon sort that out.\nWould definitely recommend to others and would stay here again on our return.", "author": {"username": "Pauline010", "num_cities": 13, "num_helpful_votes": 25, "num_reviews": 17, "num_type_reviews": 12, "id": "238339A2F15AFC70E42ED9DF7F19E04A", "location": "Aberdeen, UK"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 1776857, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "November 17, 2012", "id": 145595784, "via_mobile": false}

We actually never figured out one of the lights so we just unscrewed the lightbulbs every night. On our second day we requested and received an orientation, which was very helpful, so we could used all of the \"special features\" of the toilet. In case it appears we are completely inept, we are not....the toilet actually had to be reset so that the bidet features would work. But the toilet still malfunctioned twice in our three-day visit so that engineering had to come to reset it. So it was a little too high tech for our tastes. Also, we paid for the terrace, which is completely useless unless you are a smoker. Otherwise you would not want to spend time there since it is close to the HVAC unit so very noisy and no view. Lastly, both bars and the restaurant were completely unavailable beginning at 4pm on one of our nights because the Food Network was using the location.

The breakwast was also light, hence the name \"continental breakfast,\" with a wide variety of pastries, breads, yogurts, etc. The hotel's location was very good, right next to the Waldorf Astoria and a short walk to Saks Fifth Avenue. One negative of this hotel was that the dining portion of the room service was not 24/7, and it was only Indian food. The staff was also extremely kind and welcoming.

Very nice furnishings, clean and well-maintained. 2 big TVs; docking station for iPods. Our low-floor room was great given that the elevators can be slow. I never knew about the laundry room that others have mentioned here; I add that to the list of things the staff couldn't be bothered with telling us. Along with: no parking garage within 10 blocks will let you park overnight over Thanksgiving (we ended up at Lincoln Center 12 blocks away, on a tip from a guy at the 6th garage we tried); even though checkin is at 3pm, that doesn't necessarily mean 3, it might mean 4:30; (because \"it's really busy\" - now I know to only expect what I pay for when it's slow). I know it's been a while since I've been to NY, because I noticed the lack of pleasantries, such as \"good morning\" from a doorman or \"Did you enjoy you stay?\" from the front desk. Ah well. It's a nice place and you'll love it if you want to stay in a quieter part of the city, without being too far away from things. Fairway across the street; Starbucks on the corner; liquor store next door.

Patrick at the front desk gave me an upgrade so that I wouldn't have to wait for my room to be ready, and a $15 free mini-bar card for becoming an In Touch Member. Kevin in Maintenance was also a big help.\n3. The shower is bright and big and has a wonderful rain-shower head as well as a hand-held shower-head. (unfortunately, the floor was very slippery when wet!! Not a good thing)\n4. Beautiful, big, flat screen, high-def TV.\n5. Excellent hair dryer.\n6. Large closet with plenty of hangers, shelves, and a safe. Robes to use if you want.\n7. Big full-length mirror.\nNow the BAD things:\n The room is INSANELY DARK after the sun goes down. I needed my flashlight to unpack my suitcase and to work at the desk. And trying to get them to bring an extra lamp was like pulling teeth!! I had to basically beg many different people, before someone was able to finally find a lamp!\nThere is a nice 8 foot long desk and chair, but the unusual desk light illuminates only a tiny rectangle of space on the desk, leaving the rest of the desk in darkness. Same problem with the night table lamp that just shines directly down on a small area. And the only other lights in the room are two micro-mini recessed ceiling lights over by the window that each shine a narrow, angled beam of light directly onto the curtains. The fact that the majority of the walls are dark brown adds to the problem.\nBelieve me, I'm all for saving electricity, but there are other ways to save electricity. In ACCOR HOTELS for example, the lights will not go on unless you put your room key in a special slot by the door when you enter. So when you go out, and take your key, it is impossible to leave the lights on.\nAs I was looking through the items in the Mini-bar to use my gift card, I noticed that almost all the drinks and food items were expired. And in addition to snacks, the Mini-Bar also had items like a 3-Pack of CONDOMS, and PERSONAL LUBRICANT for sale! I was offended and disgusted! I would expect to see things like that at a seedy motel that you rent by the hour! \nI'm used to reaching into the night table to read the Bible before going to bed (all Hilton Hotels have Bibles).

Outstanding experience!\u201d", "text": "We just returned from our one night mini-vacay from NYC, and I can't wait to write about our experience staying at the San Carlos Hotel. My husband I took our sons, age 3 and 1, to NYC for a weekend trip. We truly enjoyed the hotel from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. There are three main reason why we love it, the room size, hotel amenity and the most important part, staff. My husband and I had stayed in several other hotels in the area in the past, (Affinia, Waldorf Astoria, Hilton New York and Hilton Time Square), but we found this hotel worth returning to. \nFirst of all, the size of the room is beyond expected. It felt more like a \"home\" than a hotel room. For the average price of a mid-town Manhattan hotel, we had a true one-bedroom suite with two queen size beds. The bed room was equipped with a standard size desk and a large flat screen TV. The beds were soft yet supportive. The living room had a sofa bed, two chairs, a large TV, a dining area and a kitchenette. After sitting in the stroller all afternoon waiting for us, my boys were ready for some stretching. The room provided plenty of space for them. If there is any downside to the room, that would be the view out of the window. We didn't care, since we spent most of the time exploring the city. \nThe amenities of the room were great, especially the kitchenette. It has a small refrigerator, sink, microwave, and some basic dinnerware like bowls, plates, glasses and silverware. Don't worry about bringing a cork opener, they got that, too. We brought in dinner for Sat. night, and all the items in the kitchenette made it so much easier. The breakfast was simply, yet every item was delicious. Even coffee was better than Starbucks! \nFinally, and most importantly, I truly enjoy the people that work at San Carlos. The front desk staff were very helpful and paid special attention to each guest. The captain was very accommodating to our requests. The house keeping staff were very friendly. We truly felt welcomed at the hotel. \nOn Sunday morning, my 3-year-old didn't want to go home and wanted to stay in NYC. The whole family found this experience beyond our expectations. We are looking forward to going back soon!", "author": {"username": "Eve B", "num_reviews": 2, "id": "E9022F291A01CDAC24DDF6F16C8DFA96", "location": "Herndon, Virginia, United States", "num_helpful_votes": 3}, "date_stayed": "October 2012", "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 3, "date": "October 7, 2012", "id": 142253553, "via_mobile": false}

We had a 12th floor executive suite facing 50th avenue, from 13 to 19 September.\nHotel location is OK, many restaurants at walking distance, 2 blocks away from subway station, lots of groceries stores nearby, friendly reception staff. Housekeeping is efficient. Free internet access, I could use two devices simultaneously under the same login. No room service.\nThe suite is large is disposes of kitchenette with microwave and fridge, although a toaster would have come in handy. It is quite comfortable for two people, with plenty of drawers and storing space, sofa and a small dining table with two chairs. Beware of the touch-sensitive mini-bar, unless you really want to pick up something. There are 2 large flat screen TV sets, but the program grid is limited to US channels: no French, German or Italian channel, which could add an international flair to the property. The bathroom has magnifying mirror, towels of good standard, satisfactory but not high-end toiletries. \nBed is comfortable, there is a good choice of pillows, but sleep quality was greatly disturbed by persistent air-borne noise. The windows are definitely not soundproof (the site call them \"double-glazed\"), and every kind of street noise seemed to pour into the room, from shouts and whistles late at night, to police and fire sirens all night long and delivery trucks early in the morning.\nBreakfast was better than I had expected from previous reviews. It is the usual continental type, and one would not pay less than 13 euros for it in a Parisian hotel; we would complement it upstairs with some fresh fruit bought the evening before. The breakfast room is really cramped, although that is a minor problem if you are on vacation and can manage your time schedule avoiding breakfast at peak times.\nThe San Carlos is a nice and affordable hotel in NY, adequate for a short stay and particularly suited for families with children.", "author": {"username": "Gabriel C", "num_cities": 13, "num_helpful_votes": 21, "num_reviews": 15, "num_type_reviews": 15, "id": "9B330AB13A6C8D282E82CD1BEC042156", "location": "Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"}, "date_stayed": "September 2012", "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "September 22, 2012", "id": 140920753, "via_mobile": false}

I agree with a previous reviewer, I did not want to leave and joked with the front desk I would call a real estate agent! Well, the Sherry does indeed have one, and her name is Theresa Nocerino. If you are in the market for a pied a terre, be sure to give her a call. Everyone at the hotel and in Cipriani's just raved about her.

It's in an area adjacent to I-45, just a few blocks from the edge of the downtown office towers. About a 4 block walk. But that 4 block walk, and however many more to your destination within downtown, can be brutal during the searingly hot and humid period between early June and late September. It's location is immediately adjacent to Freedman's Town in the 4th ward, an area just beginning to transition from old, delapidated wooden homes and bad street surfaces to \"gentrification\". Walking some of the streets late night might not be prudent. There is a secure parking area to the front and the rear of the property.\nAll of the rooms are suite-sized, much larger than is typical. Lots of room. Room decor is a step up from the usual blandness of most hotels, quite attractive. The room and bath were super clean. Carpet is just a bit frayed though. The beds are very comfy and soft, which I prefer. Some don't. Had a very nice white comforter, not one of those nasty bedspread things.\nThere's a microwave and refrigerator in each room. And a 42\" HDTV. BUT... no HDTV service. Go figure. They spent more than is normal in designing and furnishing the rooms, then won't bother to pay for HDTV service.\nThe bath was very clean, but average in size and design. The towels were excellent, very fluffy. BUT... no exhaust vent. Why do so many mid-to-upscale hotels not install bathroom exhaust vents?\nThe air conditioner was very efficient and quick in establishing whatever temperature we set it for. And was very quiet in doing so. Had an excellent nights sleep. \nThere's a nice pool, but it's situated a bit oddly. Most of the pool and surrounding lounging area are under the hotel's second floor, with no sun access. There is one small area at one end of the pool that does get sun from midday until early evening.\nThere is an excellent full breakfast. Which is fortunate since there's no nearby dining or shopping places.\nAll in all, a very good place to sleep well near downtown, but it's very overpriced. After all, it's just a Best Western Plus. For the same price or a few bucks more a room can be booked at nearby hotels that are actually within downtown such as the Doubletree.", "author": {"username": "xplorers2", "num_cities": 16, "num_helpful_votes": 14, "num_reviews": 20, "num_type_reviews": 17, "id": "E71C97C29E8706B074C79CB58EE63D3D", "location": "Spring, TX"}, "date_stayed": "June 2012", "offering_id": 239853, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "June 4, 2012", "id": 131281559, "via_mobile": false}
