THis is a newer hotel, but there is no service elevator. I was continually surprised after waiting for an elevator at how many stops we made for housekeeping to enter with carts, room service carts and trays, etc. How could Hyatt skip a service elevator on this new property? It really stinks at times.....its bad.\nLastly, i have traveled with world and certainly know NYC pricing. Breakfast at the Andaz ranks above almost anything i have ever paid. Apparently, i had a $190.00 breakfast for two the first morning, and $175.00 the second. Eggs for each, coffee, berries. Wow. Of course, i really don't know...as there is no bill. They just deliver it, and leave. Prices are listed in the in-suite menu, but no itemized billing is given. I am 'gifted' with a $75.00 credit for my breakfast as a Diamond member, and i assumed that had not been applied when my bill reflected a 'non itemized' charge for $110 plus for the first night, and slightly less for the second. I was wrong, it had been applied (no way for me to see this). WOW. It certainly isn't worth it.\nI know i sound like one of those guys who complains about pricing, but clearly doesn't know what things cost. Wrong. This one really surprised me, and i have traveled the world for more than 20 years staying in some of the finest hotels in the world.

Viand diner downstairs was OK for dinner -- not great but sufficient. Friendly front desk folks were really helpful -- have breakfast at Bagel Talk not too far away. Very convenient to American Museum of Natural History -- easy to catch a cab or subway.

Went with my adult daughter and we stayed in a corner room with two twin beds on the ninth floor. It's tough to find good hotels with two beds in a room in NYC so this was a bonus. The room was very quiet. I could not hear anyone from other rooms, the hallway or any street noise. The room has a sleek modern design and was spacious for NYC standards. I loved the bathroom. Being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was great and snacks in the rooms was a nice touch.\nI also loved the overall vibe of the hotel; small, hip, clean, and friendly. Great artwork. Not warm and cozy though. The seating in the \"lobby\" is not particularly comfortable or inviting. The staff was young and not as experienced as one would find at a five-star hotel but this is not a five-star hotel. They did the best they could to help with restaurant reservations, shopping information and other general information. Easy walk from here to Grand Central Station to hop the subway and cabs easy to find. Loved being across from The New York Pubic Library and Bryant Park. Lovely pop-up stores and ice skating in Bryant Park for the holidays. Beats the craziness of Rockefeller Center in my book. \nThere are a few problems that I believe can be corrected easily. One is the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. It is very dark and would be really difficult if you were trying to get ready for a special event. Also there is no drawer space and the closet is minuscule. Not sure how to correct that issue. The other problem is that the beds, at least the twins we slept in, were not very comfortable. Very firm which is fine if you like it that way.

For some reason it was just a better experience than the restaurant.\n* Do use the concierge for tickets, restaurant and visitor recommendations. Everything they suggested worked perfectly and they enhanced our stay hugely.\n* Don't be afraid to walk and when I say walk I mean stroll. Take your time, look around and you'll be surprised how easy it is to get to places on foot. Empire State Building is insanely close by, Madison Square Garden a short walk beyond that. Rockerfeller Center, Broadway and Times Square make an easy and fun circular route and you can stroll up 5th Avenue to Central Park and beyond quite easily.\n* Subways are a nightmare to find if you're used to the clear signposting in London or Paris but once you done it once or twice you'll get the hang of it. The Setai is no more than a block or two in any direction from the subway.\n* Taxis are a law unto themselves.

A stranger did it for me! Once checked in, an employee decided to show me to the room with me trailing along with my luggage and holding the door to the elevator for him. I finally told him to take the luggage. Once in the room I was told that I was not allowed to adjust the temperature of the room on the thermostat. When I asked about the window heating/AC unit, he proceeded to fiddle with it. I told him to be sure that it was off. He lied and said it was off. It was not off. I later had to get the engineer to turn it completely off as the prior employee had activated a timer that was cycling it on and off. There is no lighting in the closet or for that whole end of the room where I was attempting to unpack. I took the minimum out of my bag for fear of losing the other things in the dark. All wall plugs are completely filled with the hotel's stuff. I had to get down on my hands and knees to find a strip plug underneath the desk for my IPad to charge. Then I found an outlet on the side of the desk for my IPhone to charge. However, to my dismay the next morning I found that when I turned off the desk light, the desk plug also went dead and my phone did NOT charge overnight. The mattress was good and that is why this hotel received three stars instead of two. Now, the shower: I scalded my right arm turning off the shower because there are absolutely NO markings on the shower as where hot, cold or off is. I recommend that you step outside the tub/shower before turning it off and be sure not to have any part of you under the water when turning it off. There is no ventilation in the bathroom. Therefore, not only was the bathroom completely steamed, which ruined my hair, but also the bedroom windows. As to the so-called BAY window in my room: The top half of the windows is completely blacked out by the hotel eliminating half the light coming in the windows. And this room really needs more light. In addition, there are dark brown wooden shutters that cannot be lifted, only tilted that further curtail light entering this room. What a dismal swamp it is. Breakfast: there was an argument about whether or not I was allowed to order the continental breakfast, being first told no and later told yes. And then there was the issue with the eggs. Even when I told them how many minutes to boil the eggs, the cook could not do the eggs even half way cooked to wear I asked. Not a good situation, in my opinion. Sleeping: Although the mattress was comfortable, I had to wear earplugs and play a sound soother to sleep well. When the neighboring room turned on its shower, the water sound screamed and bubbled right at the headboard to my bed. I checked out in the AM for a conference, stored my luggage at the hotel and was allowed to use the gym in the late PM to change my shoes for my trip home in the early evening. I am attempting to be fair and point out the good, too. And finally, when I noted some of the deficiencies to the person who originally escorted me to my room his answer was: \"It is What it is.\" Now that I am safely at home, I can laugh at this most ridiculous interpretation of customer service I have ever heard.", "author": {"username": "9Adventuress", "num_cities": 9, "num_helpful_votes": 26, "num_reviews": 20, "num_type_reviews": 13, "id": "212787FEB4E7A223D38277943BCA6E55", "location": "Cockeysville, Maryland"}, "date_stayed": "December 2012", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "December 7, 2012", "id": 146977843, "via_mobile": false}

They recognized us each time we walked in and out, which made things really great.

Ours had 2 queen beds and not much room for anything else. The one negative was that it was rather dimly lit even when we turned on every last light, but from what I understand this is a green hotel and they are saving on energy and wattage. However, we would have liked to have the room a bit brighter since there was also a lot of woodwork and dark closet doors which also made the room on the dark side even during the day. The beds were extremely comfortable with nice white fluffy duvet comforters and down pillows. There were a lot of outlets and close to the bed (and located on the nightstands) which were great for charging phones and computers.\nWe were on a high floor with nice views. The rooms with two beds don't face the empire state building, which was a bummer because we hoped to see it from the windows.

Our suite, #1000, had the most amazing view of Rockefeller Centre. Also, the windows open nice and wide, which was good because the hotel has that stuffy old hotel air, which gives it its charm but also makes it hard to sleep at night. Of course opening the window makes it louder than normal; I brought earplugs.

When your on a quick 4 day'er, you don't spend any time in it anyway. It had a TV, dresser draws, a little fridge, a good sized bathtub shower and a desk with chair. Pretty standard. \nUnfortunately, we did not eat in the hotel restaurant but a lady in the elevator told me that it was great. Within a 5 block radius there are plenty of restaurants and Irish Pubs (which happen to be my favourite!), so the hotel ammendities were not that important to me on this trip. There is a good, reasonably priced, family style restaurant at the end of the block called \"the red flame\". Great breakfast diner restaurant for it's price. \nAs I mentioned, the hotel is close to everything. Don't kid yourself though, if you are in New York to see the sights, you will be walking alot.

And the reality two non sparkling bottles of water. If I wanted to have some coke it was necessary to use room service. It was not overpriced but still very annoying. And the promise given has not been fulfilled.\nThe other negative aspect was that we were not provided with advantages as LHW members except for thenice personal letter from the manager. Usually we receive at least some fruits, uograde, free internet or something...\nThe last negative point was about pre arrival assistance and concierge. We sent some requirements before our arrival but got answer only very late as our email was categorized as spam and the concierge had not chcecked the spam folder. We also had some difficulties with our reservation when in the city and were not able to reach the concierge via phone. We succeeded only after 15 minutes and sixth call. \nOne great tip about the hotel: no checkout time limit. Pretty good!\nDespite small negative issues we very much enjoyed the stay and can honestly recommend the hotel to others.", "author": {"username": "CzechTourist", "num_cities": 23, "num_helpful_votes": 19, "num_reviews": 27, "num_type_reviews": 23, "id": "93204D751F8796489DB9807AE98C2979", "location": "Prague, the Czech Republic"}, "date_stayed": "October 2012", "offering_id": 1776857, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "December 4, 2012", "id": 146744546, "via_mobile": false}

We stayed an unfortunate four nights at this hotel, and suffered major itching, including a major let down from what we were advised BEFORE booking at The Chatwal! We phoned prior to booking to ensure that the hotel had bathtubs (as our personal preference, we only book with hotels which have bathtubs) - we were advised that EVERY room has a bathtub - excellent, so we booked. We arrived all the way from New Zealand (19 hours of flight-time) at approximately 11:00pm to arrive to a major disappointment. NO BATHTUB! We phoned the desk from our room and were advised \"sorry, there's nothing we can do as all rooms with a bathtub are taken\". We then advised that prior to booking we were advised that ALL ROOMS have a bathtub - \"no sorry, you were told wrong, and there's nothing I can do but you are welcome to leave\". Then my husband went downstairs and spoke to the \"duty manager\" who then finally relented and looked up to see who would be checking out the following morning so we could get a room with a bathtub. We were then promised a room with a bathtub by 12:00 midday, but by the next morning, the woman at the desk advised \"sorry, but they are now checking out at 4:00pm\", so we asked for a refund for the first day since the whole inconvenience had ruined a whole entire travel day (WE had been trying to sort out this mess OURSELVES all night long and the following morning by arranging a room with a bathtub) - their reply \"sorry, there's nothing I can do\" - she didn't even offer any complimentary gestures as a way of saying sorry for the inconvenience caused by this ridiculous hotel! We would have loved to have checked out and moved to another hotel, however, upon such short notice and only arranging three days in New York, time was very restricted. This hotel is PERFECT FOR BACKPACKERS WHO HAVE MONEY! The hotel is so small and running on a strictly cheap budget that there is no doorman in the morning upon check-out.

When getting out of the taxi, we had our bags taken care of right away and directed towards the check in counter. We had no problems at check in, and received a complimentary room upgrade which was a pleasant surprise.

Leather closet doors that looked like trunks, an excellent bar area, and a comfortable big bed. The bathroom is amazing. While there was no bathtub, the shower made up for it as it was very large, and the toilet was quite neat with all these japanese style options. The amenities provided were also excellent.\nWe also used the butler service to have our shoes shined, and clothes pressed before dinner.\nHad a chance to use the pool, and gym facilities, which were adequate, but they were working with the space they had.\nThe location was very close to Times Square, so that was convenient, but isolated so the noise and traffic would not affect your stay.\nOur four night stay was quite pleasant, however you get what you pay for, and the Chatwal is pricey.

We used our Starwood points for the room. Little pricey, but it's a nifty hotel. The lobby area is small, but with gorgeous Art Deco. Interior of The Lambs Club restaurant is also really lovely. It's right off Times Square, so location is good for most things.\nRooms at the Chatwal aren't super big, but this is NYC and this is a retro location, so I didn't expect massive space. What they lack in size, they make up for in appointments. The rooms are done up kind of like I'd imagine a 1920s cruise ship. Leather doors with leather handles, kind of like old time steamer trunks. Lots of cubbies and efficient use of space. Cool bar. Bathrooms are awesome. As others have mentioned, the toilets have an unreal number of functions--bidet, seat warmer, air dry. Too many functions, really, but fun when you're on vacation.\nOur room was facing the alley, so nothing great on the view. But the room was nice enough that it didn't matter. Wish the bed had been a bit more comfy and higher off the floor--all the beds seemed very, very low--but overall I was pretty happy with the space. Service was great as well. Free shoe shine and you have a butler who can handle things like pressing your suit or dress for dinner.\nDid have a bad situation, which highlights the excellence of the service. We'd been given a room with a connecting door. Unfortunately, next door were three single guys having a weekend in the city and the noise was unreal. Like they were standing right next to you talking in your ear while you were trying to sleep. So we got to participate when they got room service at 2 a.m. when they got up at 8:30 and then again when the maids came in to clean at 9. After the first night, we complained to the desk and they gave us a new room.\nWe went out for the day and when we came back, they'd packed all of our things and moved them for us. And they were thorough--they even found the charger my husband had left plugged into the wall. So have to give them credit for the assist.\nThat said, if you walk into your room and there's a connecting door and you're not with the people staying in the next room, immediately get a new one. You will hear everything.\nOverall I enjoyed it. Honestly, I was probably expecting a little more for the level, so I wouldn't say it exceeded my expectations, but it was very nice. My gold status didn't really get us much of anything, so can't say Starwood helped much, other than to use the points. It's not inexpensive. It was 30,000 points plus per night, and more than $700 if we'd paid out of pocket. Not out of sync for this level in NYC, but the St. Regis was on the same point level and I can't say I think it's better than that. \nBottom line--if you're looking for something retro and cool, it's great. If you need something more modern or a lot of space, probably not for you.", "author": {"username": "dagnyt", "num_cities": 10, "num_helpful_votes": 43, "num_reviews": 15, "num_type_reviews": 12, "id": "2460DAC350A498A3DB494E1FE485F32C", "location": "Tallahassee, Florida"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 1641016, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "November 20, 2012", "id": 145838274, "via_mobile": false}

We had just come from two weeks at The Greenwich Hotel in Tribeca which was fantastic.\nThe ONLY reason this did not get a poorer rating is that the building is in a convenient location, this was a reason we choose not to move. You are right opposite Central Park with the horse and carriages and in short walking distance to all the main Fifth Avenue shops. Other positives were; spacious bedroom, heaps of wardrobe space, free wifi, free sodas that were refilled every day, comfy bed, plenty of bathroom amenities, choice of newspaper, heaps of TV channels and a coffee machine. Godiva chocolates were placed on our pillow at night, which you do not see often nowadays. There were a lot of old world touches.\nRather than give you two weeks of examples of the poor service we received, I will list just a few, remembering we are paying $700+ per night, it was $635 and then you add all the taxes. Before I start with the negatives, the reason for my heading is that Sherry lacks a lot of services that a hotel has, for example, there is no lounge to go sit in, read and watch the world go by. There is no casual area to have a coffee or snack, just a small lobby with a couple of chairs so if you are staying here for any length of time, you are stuck in your room. There is no pool to go sit by. A previous reviewer stated that their stay was \u201codd\u201d and now I understand why. For two weeks I was able to watch how the staff treat the hotel guests versus the residents of the building and it is very different, in fact, we felt like we were imposing and intruding, we did not feel like hotel guests. The concierge\u2019s were polite but they had this underlying tone and attitude. \nSo we arrive at the Sherry and are greeted by Alvin who collects our bags. We are checked in by the concierge and given a nice welcome until she looks at my passport photo and tells me how much I have aged. Now I just laughed it off, however upon reflection, this lady did not know me and is that appropriate behaviour from a five star hotel? Or maybe it is not a five star hotel, it is a residential building and she became too familiar with us?\nAlvin takes us up to our room and we step out to renovations occurring on the second floor, which is where our room is. The concierge forgot to inform us of this when checking in. Alvin points out that the Business Centre is closed for renovation and lucky for us they have relocated it right next door to our room. Alvin shows us our room, we tip him and he stated that he is a native New Yorker and if we need anything he is around \u2013 we never saw Alvin again until check out two weeks later when he picked up our bags. There was a box of Godiva chocolates and flowers welcoming us. There were also two notes from the management. Both notes had different and incorrect spellings of my name. My booking was made by my travel agent so they had all the details \u2013 oh and my surname, only has four letters and my Christian name is also very easy. \nI wondered about the renovations going on but at that time (it was about 3pm in the afternoon on a weekday) we could not hear any noise, so unpacked and settled in. We were happy. In fact, during the whole two week stay we did not actually hear much of the renovation going on, it is what woke us up each morning. As stated above, there was board on the floor in the hall way stuck together by masking tape. Each night it was removed and every morning (weekday) it was re-laid. So between 8.00 \u2013 8.30am you would hear the ripping of masking tape and while doing this the person laying the board would have a very loud conversation with the housekeeping staff or other tradesmen, right near our room. So rather than wake up naturally, without fail we were woken by the staff of the \u201chotel\u201d. There were mornings on the weekend when I woke up to the housekeeping staff calling out to bring more towels or for a staff member calling for security on her walkie talkie. My tip to the Sherry, if your guest has the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign up and the paper is still outside their door it indicates they are still asleep.\nThe bathroom \u2013 it was small. However, we had a bath, great I thought! Then I looked at the bottom of it, the non-slip surface was fifty shades of grey, there was no way I was sitting on that. It needed to be replaced or given a damn good bleach.\nThis leads me into housekeeping, extremely inconsistent. If a hotel is renovating and it expects its guests to stay within the area during this phase then the housekeeping needs to be vigilant with keeping building dust to a minimum. After about four days I noticed the build up of dust. It is important to note here that there was a lot of drawers and wardrobe space so we did not leave a lot of personal items out on the side cabinets or tables. The housekeeping did not have to move any personal items to dust. By day five I was able to write words into the dust, I wrote \u201chello\u201d on the TV stand and it still did not get cleaned. Day seven it did, only because I happened to be in the room at the time. I am not sure if the bathroom got cleaned, as there was a pubic hair on the daddo by the toilet and stayed there for the full two weeks with all the dust.\nNow there are plenty more examples to provide but the piece de resistance was room service. We had been eating in a lot of restaurants and decided to stay in one night. I said to my husband all I feel like is a toasted cheese sandwich. He rings room service and orders one each. We get our order \u2013 two plates with covers. First thing we notice, only one glass of water, we laugh. Then we lift the lid and were shocked. The toasted sandwich was that, a cheese toasted sandwich. Not what you expect from a five star kitchen: there was no parsley for decoration, no fries, no salad just plain crappy white bread with plastic cheese and the crusts cut off and it was very dry (took a photo of it). Now you are probably saying, yeah, that is what you wanted. Yes but guess what we paid when I asked my husband what the amount was on the bill - $41.00 for two toasted sandwiches and one glass of water. I would not have minded if we got some fries and salad with that. In all my travels and I have been travelling most of my life that would go down as the worst hotel dish I have seen and the biggest RIP OFF! By the way, based on this dish we did not even want to waste our time and money going to the restaurant. \nMy tip if you are staying at the Sherry, go around corner to the deli we got beautiful sushi (spicy crab) for $5.75. Also for the international visitors who may not know, you can take your washing to a dry cleaner and they do it for you, usually one pound of clothing costs about $1.00. We had 44 items of clothing washed and it cost $20.\nBY the way I was happy to put all of this into a customer satisfaction feedback form but there was not one in our room. So with this experience in mind, go to a proper hotel, a place that provides the amenities a hotel of five star standard should. We certainly noticed the difference when we checked in at the Peninsula in Beverly Hills after staying at the Sherry \u2013 now there is a hotel!

Apparently on the pent house floor there are also hospitality suites directly across the hall from the guest suites. By design this is a very poor choice by the hotel as hospitality suites are typically for parties. Yes, we were staying across the hall from a loud drunken open house party! The music was loud, the people were in and out of the suite causing a big disturbance in our suite. A note was slipped under our door by the Party Hostess suggesting that she knew it was loud and that we should join them. This is not at all what we had in mind for our wedding night. At 12:30am when we couldn't take anymore we checked out and found another hotel. The attendant at the front desk was considerate and understanding as we conveyed the issues and didn't charge us for the room. I can only think that the rental price for the Hospitality Suite was much more than our guest suite as no additional solutions to the problem were offered. The whole experience was frustrating.

After much searching with AmEx emergency services (Great job from them as well), The Eventi showed up as the only practical option.\nI travel frequently and I often stay at Kimpton properties because I like their unique designs. I am low-maintenance when I'm on the road and it is rare that the performance of the staff has any significant impact on my stay. After a harrowing five days of urban camping in my powerless and waterless apartment, the Eventi staff took us all in like family, and made the world seem safe and normal again.\nPatrick, Gabriella , and I wish I could remember everyone's names, but suffice it to say that the entire desk and valet staff were phenomenal. Robert, the GM, has pulled together a special group of people. They greeted us warmly and played with our dogs. The next morning, staff that we hadn't even met knew the names of the animals and would greet them by name when I took them out for walks. They offered treats. They even remebered that one dog likes her head scratched and the other one likes his butt scratched. They helped us with dry cleaning and laundry. The housekeeping staff were excellent and had the room spotlessly clean every day - even the fur was gone. When I had to bring a cat from my apartment because she was ill, a filled litter pan and a small bag of cat food was waiting outside the room door when I returned (I never even thought to ask for one). Our menagerie ended up staying for eight days until we confirmed that we would not be able to return to our apartment for several months, and we relocated out of State to stay with family. One night, I was bringing back pizza to eat in the room (from Waldie's - an excellent pie). The doorman saw the box and said \"Aha! You discovered Waldie's. Their pizza is fantastic\". A few minutes later, we were all sharing the pizza in the lobby and laughing and telling stories around the front desk like we had all been friends since college.\nAs for the room: Beautiful. Quite subdued by Kimpton standards, with lots of dark wood and chocolate tones. Very contemporary and elegant. Terrific bed, sheets and pillows.

The hotel and room were meticulously clean and well maintained, which is always my first priority. Location is great, close to subway stops and walking distance to Penn station. Location is of course subjective in NYC, depending on where you need to be.\nWe stayed in a city-view king on the 18th floor. Spectacular views, our room faced east so we had an excellent view of the Empire State Building. Road noise was reasonable during the day and practically non-existent at night with the blinds drawn. HVAC noise was of course present but within a reasonable level. Room was perfectly clean, great condition, and quite sizable by city standards. Bathroom was spacious, modern and functional. My only complaint with the entire property was with the bed. I prefer a really firm mattress and this one was a bit soft for my liking. Actually seemed like the topper could use replacing. That being said we slept fine, pillows and linens were nice.\nWe ate breakfast and dinner in the restaurant and the food was very good. Culinary choices are plentiful in NYC but it\u2019s nice to know that you can also get quality food without leaving the hotel. There\u2019s also a free wine hour in the late afternoon which my wife took advantage of, she commented that it was a great opportunity to meet other travelers.\nThe staff were friendly and attentive. We arrived at around 11AM expecting to just drop off our luggage but they had a room available so we were able to check in immediately. The day we checked out it was raining so I asked the staff were I could get an umbrella. They said we could use the one from the room, even though we were checking out, and to just return it before we left the city. These are just little things that make the stay more enjoyable.\nGreat hotel, great stay, would highly recommend.", "author": {"username": "Jeff128", "num_cities": 3, "num_helpful_votes": 4, "num_reviews": 3, "num_type_reviews": 3, "id": "D1B05304E01C2916FDAC1141CA2C93B3", "location": "Albany, New York"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 1456560, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "December 3, 2012", "id": 146699142, "via_mobile": false}

Setting this trip in context, we are the parents of a profoundly learning disabled son and we had to negotiate and save our respite care for a year so that we could have our first holiday alone since our honeymoon. This was to be the most luxurious,spoilt treat of our lifetime.\nIn April, we booked the Suite Surrender package staying in an Empire State Suite. The package at that time was similar to the one currently on offer which promised:\n\u2022 The attention of a Personal Assistant, a signature service provided by Capella Hotels and Resorts\n\u2022 A couture kitchen filled with New York City\u2019s finest flavors, stocked once and entirely prior to your arrival\n\u2022 Complimentary refreshment center \n\u2022 A bottle of Taittinger Ros\u00e9 champagne and fresh fruit upon arrival\n\u2022 a $100 Auriga credit per night for treatments in-suite or in the luxurious Auriga spa. \n\u2022 Complimentary pressing of up to 5 items and shoe shine on the date of your arrival\nUnlike the current offer, we were not promised the Bergdorf Goodman voucher but instead a luxury breakfast delivered daily to our suite. \nI specified that I wanted a room on as high a floor as possible and emphasised that this was a special occasion.\nWe were waiting for the call from our personal assistant prior to our arrival, but the call didn't come.\nOn arrival at the hotel, the door men did not open the door as we struggled through with our luggage and with only one member of staff on duty at reception joined the line to check in. Things started to look up when we were told we had been upgraded as this was a special occasion and we were allocated room 2702. Bizarrely,we were walked to the elevator and whilst in the elevator the promise of pressed clothes was explained -surely this should have been done at the reception desk? \nStill, we headed to our room, excited about our upgrade. This was an eagerly anticipated stay, so I had devoured the website and all of the photos, so when I entered the City one bedroom suite I was disappointed. This was NOT and upgrade but a DOWN grade. Although this suite was bigger in square footage, it was a cheaper suite. We looked for the bottle of champagne and fruit but there was none. We looked in the fridge for the finest flavours of NYC and found 6 small bottles of soda a bottle of water and four milk creamers for coffee.\nI was gutted.\ni phoned down to reception but no-one answered. I phoned the personal assistant line only to told it was nothing to do with them and I needed to contact reception. I explained I could not get through and asked if the city room was a lower grade room than an empire room, I was told by the personal assistant that it was a downgrade and she put me on hold and eventually through to reception. No apology was forthcoming for the poor service in fact I felt reprimanded for challenging the upgrade and was told that the suites had been renamed since I booked and that I indeed had an upgrade. Strange though that the same names are advertised currently on the website and that indeed, the empire suite is about $300 a night more expensive that our city room.\nThe receptionist said she would send up the missing elements of our package when it was checked out. We were by now exhausted, having been travelling for over 21 hours. We had just wanted to crack open the champagne, drink to our anniversary and get some rest. We waited over an hour for the delivery and then decided to get some sleep as the goods were clearly not coming. Half an hour into our sleep the door was persistently knocked. My husband had to get up, dress and answer the door to receive:\n the bottle of champagne\n the fresh fruit - this was in fact a small plate of sliced fruit salad.\n a wine glass with more fresh fruit salad and plain yoghurt\n a dish of nuts\n three one oz pieces of cheese on a tray\n a four pack of beer\n a four pack of root beer.\n~Sorry, but do these latter 4 items classify as New York's finest flavors? In a five star hotel, I was expecting a lot more. AND they did NOT stock the fridge, they barely filled one shelf.\nOn rising on Sunday 28th October, we headed to Ai Fiori with our complimentary breakfast vouchers. Again, we had been promised luxury breakfasts in our room, instead we were given 6 continental breakfast vouchers for a muffin, croissant and danish with orange juice and a coffeee. Hardly luxury. Even this was poorly served. We submitted our vouchers and then were billed $60. We finished our coffees and had to ask for a refill. My husband called over the waiter, he went for the coffee pot, then filled my husband's cup and walked away leaving my cup empty. Surely, a Michelin starred restaurant has heard of silver service?\nWe headed out into Manhattan. We would have loved at this point to have had our personal assistant organise a ride in the Maserati as we were heading to Tiffanys to get a ring to celebrate our occasion, but as for the entire duration of our stay, we were not allocated a personal assistant \"the signature service provided,\" therefore we did not get that opportunity.\nOn no occasion, did any member of staff apology for the lack of service or the failure to provide what was being paid for. All of these issues are basic customer care issues, a product was ordered and it was down to the staff of the Setai to deliver, but this was a total failure.\nSubsequent issues resulted from the skeleton staff in situ.\nWhen we arrived back in the hotel after our few hours in Manhattan, we picked up the letter stating that due to the imminent arrival of Hurricane Sandy, we would not have a housekeeping service. So we did not have any of the snacks delivered each afternoon that previous guests have raved about. We did not have any amenities replaced - i.e. soaps, and when we ran out of Nespresso capsules it took 3 requests and 9 hours before we had them delivered. We appreciate that staff were under pressure by this time, but we offered to collect the capsules from reception on two occasions and on each we were told they would be sent up to our room, without any apology. Ironically, they arrived 30 minutes before the power outage.\nOn Monday, we had no restaurant service and had to eat in the bar. In the evening, we were provided with a buffet dinner at a cost of $25 per person. Two choices of main course, one potato, one veg. Considering the conditions,$25 was taking advantage.\nBy Monday night, the power was out and so we were in darkness, no elevators (Essential on the 27th floor), no hot water in the morning and bread, cheese and ham for breakfast. \nIn summation, during our luxury break we had:\n A downgraded room - one bedroom suite instead of Empire state - which had been specifically requested\n No personal assistant service\n One turndown service\n No daily clean of suite for entire stay\n None of the promised surrender package (until minimum arrived after complaint)\n No breakfast in suite\n Use of the Nespresso machine for one out of three days (due to lack of capsules)\n One breakfast in Ai Fiori\n Power and hot water for two out of three nights.\nYet, we were billed the full amount for our stay of over $3400. We did mention the lack of the suite surrender package, specifically mentioning the lack of the spa vouchers and were cheekily told that we could have the vouchers. What use would they have been with the spa closed and the power out?\nWe were offered a 50% reduction on the cost of our final night - the one with no power, water or food, which we did take BUT we were greatly under stress by this point. We had just been told our flight was cancelled, our son was due home with noone to care for him and we had to find a hotel in a city where 9000 flights had been cancelled stranding many others in a similar situation. With hindsight, we were sold short. We should been paying the cost of a one bedroom suite -without the package, we should have had the $100 per night spa voucher returned along with $120 the apparent cost of the four breakfasts we did not get. Without basic housekeeping we should have received some compensation. Our lifetime holiday- an opportunity we will NEVER have again, was in ruins. Not due to Sandy, but due to uncaring, inhospitable staff. \nWe are very understanding of the difficult situation that staff were put in when NYC went into close down, but it needs to be stated that in our \"new\" hotel, the Westin Grand Central, we were made to feel very welcome, we were given free coffee when we arrived to check if they had room, they gave us free wifi for our entire stay to allow us to get in contact with home to make arrangements for our son and they had such a friendly outlook that staff in the Setai could learn from. \nThis was sent to the Setai management and a phonecall to discuss this has been promised, but as yet has not happened. It appears from subsequent reviews that our experience was not unique yet others seem to have a magical time.

They recommend a few local shops and food places if we wanted to pass the time.

I do not cope well with confined spaces etc but the speed of the lifts was excellent and I managed to survive the constant use! :). We arrived at our room and it appeared we had been given a larger room (possibly because I emailed in advance) and we also received a complimentary bottle of wine and box of chocolates which was a lovely touch. The room was excellent, large, spacious, very clean with more than enough storage. The views from our huge window were fantastic! The concierge were attentive and informative without being pushy (this was my partners 6th time in NYC and they did not feel the need to tell her anything as she had good local knowledge). \nEven though NYC pretty much shut down for a few days, the housekeeping service was still available (albeit on a reduced staff) and they were very polite. If you are there for a few nights (we were for 5) I would recommend that on your first morning to leave a $10 dollar tip and a note to housekeeping then leave $2/$3 for the duration of your stay and you will end up with plenty of extra toiletries/towels/pillows etc or anything else you may need. \nThe hotel staff kept all guests up to date with information regarding local facilities that were still available during the hurricane. \nWe were both very impressed with Hotel Beacon and the staff and will certainly be planning on staying there again when we visit again next year.

Tried putting AC on high for a while to change the air but it didn't do much of a difference. Other than that small inconvenience, bed clean, very comfortable and couldn't ask for anything else.

The hotel was pleasant enough, but a bit overrated in my opinion, mostly due to inconsistent service. My brother also happened to be staying at the hotel, using the same flash sale but for a longer stay, so we were able to compare our experiences. His room was actually directly above ours.\nFirst off, I would have to say this is not my favourite New York neighbourhood--5th Ave. between 36th and 37th. While such tourist sites as the Empire State Building, Macy's and Lord and Taylor are nearby, I prefer the sites and shops on or near 5th Ave. 15-25 blocks north-- Saks, Barneys, the Top of the Rock, MOMA. Bryant Park, the NY Public Library and the Morgan Library are also nearby. When we walked from the hotel toward Times Square to catch a play (\"The Heiress\"), we walked down a street (37th?) that had store after store of cheesy discount evening gowns.\nThe hotel itself is lovely, occupying the lower floors of a 57 story building designed by Gwathmey Siegel, who did the Guggenheim Museum's addition. This was one of Charles Gwathmey's last projects before his untimely passing. Perhaps most unique are the hotel's angular windows that open to let in a decent amount of fresh air. The lobby is more like a foyer, not really a space to sit and relax, but has some nice design touches, especially the curved stairway leading to the 2nd floor restaurant (A Fiori) and the pendulous teardrop-like sculpture in its centre. The Bar on Fifth, where one can sit and relax, is just beyond the lobby. The hotel has a flexible check-in/check-out policy, so when we arrived rather early after our red-eye flight, our room was ready. A very kind and friendly bellman escorted us to the room and remembered and acknowledged us whenever we passed by later on.\nOur room was a Standard Room, the lowliest of room categories. It was actually quite spacious by New York standards (420 sq. feet), with almost half the space occupied by the sumptuously appointed bathroom, leaving the bedroom area a bit cramped. The next room category up, the Superior room, has the same square footage but a larger bedroom and smaller bath. The room was sleekly designed in shades of brown and beige, with wood paneling. The view was a \"courtyard\" view of the backsides of buildings that faced 36th or 37th St.--there was actually a good amount of natural light, and the bathroom also had a window, All windows were floor to ceiling. The bath had a dual head shower (rain or hand-held) over the tub. \nWhat I liked:\nThe complimentary Nespresso machine and refreshment centre (minifridge with sodas and water--no minibar). The high definition TV. The aforementioned angular windows. The nicely designed door jam that is a refreshingly modern alternative to the standard chain and bolt. The bath toiletries. The large WC alcove.\nWhat was less impressive:\nThe highly touted Duxiana bed was low-slung--a box spring topped by what looked like a mattress topper but no mattress (A peek at the Duxiana website shows that this is in fact one of their bed's designs--the \"magic\" apparently is in the number of springs in the base. Yes, it was comfortable, but not out of this world). Only 2 king pillows--4 would have been nice. Only one hand towel and one face cloth, but 2 bath towels and 2 bath sheets. The WC alcove could have used a door. Our shower curtain was full-length, but the one in my brother's room was at least a foot short of the tub ledge, leaving a frightfully dangerous, slippery wet marble surface after showering--a lawsuit waiting to happen. The TV is not wall-mounted, but rather sits on top of the desk, usurping valuable space. There is free Wifi, but no one told me you needed a password. The closet in the Standard rooms are not full length. The bedside cordless phones are hard to operate. The desk phone has a large lighted screen than cannot be dimmed while sleeping. We did not receive morning newspaper delivery, nor did my brother on any day. My brother got cookies with turndown, we got water from the refreshment centre. After we had checked-in (early), we spent an hour or so in the room, during which time the housekeeping staff and others could clearly be heard going about their business. At least 3 people tried to enter the room, only one knocked (luckily we had the door jam engaged). We heard a lot of doors opening and closing--it turned out the room across the way from ours was being used as a housekeeping storage room. A stairway door was also nearby.\nOur package included breakfast (a set value to be used in the restaurant or in-room), which we took in the restaurant--quite nice. Interestingly, for some selections, one is not served potatoes, but always a small salad. We also had late night room service (club sandwiches)-- also quite nice, and again with salads instead of carbs. There is a spa and salon that occupies the 4th floor, but we did not try these services. The fitness centre is on the 3rd floor (although the elevators say its on the 4th), as is the business centre--2 small key-accessed rooms housing computers and printers.\nIf this hotel was situated in an area more suited to my likings, it would definitely be on the list of possible accommodations. Even now, I would consider a return visit, but the luxury hotel milieu in Manhattan is highly competitive and somewhat large, so the Setai must pay attention to every detail to stay in the game.", "author": {"username": "pillowsofwanderlust", "num_cities": 20, "num_helpful_votes": 231, "num_reviews": 57, "num_type_reviews": 49, "id": "3F88F8D4F220EFE6418ED0B22AAF03E6", "location": "Los Angeles CA"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 1776857, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "November 22, 2012", "id": 145940048, "via_mobile": false}

We stayed with what we knew and have not been dissappointed.\nThe executive floor was under renovation but this did not detract from our stay. We had a very comfortable room - twin queen beds, large work area, big bathroom, all the needed facilities - tea, coffee, iron, toiletries and safe. Ceramic cups would be better than the paper ones for the room though.\nThe staff made our stay this time round. The valet was great - parking to allow us to get situated etc.., Guest Services exceptional - quick, efficient and polite. Requests for fridge, bathrobe, unblocking toilet, toilet paper, towels and linen were all effectively handled and we did not feel like we were \"bothering\" them - to the contrary - \"we are happy to help to make sure your stay is memorable\". And this over Thanksgiving! We were also given free wifi as our Thankgiving gift. The first receptionist we dealt with was a bit iffie. Her supervisor corrected her deficiencies.\nParking at $30 per night is very expensive. We were transported by my daughter and did not need a car. However, casual parking for her was expensive at $8 per 2 hours. The hotel does offer a good shuttle service to downtown (Macy's etc) and will fetch you. This was really appreciated. \nWe will be back to see my daughter and husband and will stay here again if possible.", "author": {"username": "Rob N", "num_cities": 15, "num_helpful_votes": 36, "num_reviews": 31, "num_type_reviews": 15, "id": "8DBE6B92BDAB99A83D1F8DB8EA56C6AA", "location": "Johannesburg, South Africa"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 282699, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "November 25, 2012", "id": 146186982, "via_mobile": false}

The quality of materials in the room exceeds your typical Marriott room. Large LG flat screen TV, good carpets, good drapes, fixtures, etc. all of nice quality. Great 4 cup coffee maker.\nBathroom: Good size, nice granite counters, huge Jacuzzi tub, huge shower with the best water pressure I have ever experienced. Tub and shower were clean, but Jacuzzi was very hard to activate; a maintenance man showed us how to turn it on by repeatedly using shallow pushes to the start button. Also, several jets came off while using the tub. It\u2019s a nice feature but was not maintained. \nBed: Very good bed. \nHouskeeping: Average. We left a tip requested extra bath towels. Housekeeping took the tip but did not leave towels. \nRestaurants: We cannot recommend the hotel restaurant. We had the full breakfast buffet on Thanksgiving morning. Both the food and staff were sub-par. The buffet was not restocked, and we had to scavenge the dregs of what remained. Several core items were out of stock on the buffet including jam and fruit. The bacon was swimming in grease. We finally asked the staff to bring us fruit, and they did. However, the staff\u2019s attitude was lackadaisical at best. We even had to get up to get our own water after waiting an extended period of time.

And the valets were very knowledgeable about downtown and restaurants. Use caution at night downtown. There are many bums in this part of downtown. I worked nearby at Pennzoil Place (about 5 blocks away) in the late 90s, and never noticed bums during the day. But they are everywhere at night, even urinating in public.

The building is beautiful, I believe it was a bank at one time, and you can still see the old vault behind the reception area. There are various room configurations, so make sure you know what you are getting when you book. They have accessible rooms, which is great if you require this access, but not so great if you don\u2019t need it. There is no pool at this hotel, and they have no agreements with any local hotels for access to their pool. It would have been nice for a cool down after a hot day, but not a deal breaker, if you're there on business.\nI found my room to be clean and the furnishings in excellent condition. I had a corner room, so I had lots of windows and light. The ceilings are nice and high, which adds to the feeling of space. There is a large desk, and Wi-Fi is free, so it\u2019s great for business travelers. I had a very comfortable King bed in my room and the pillows were OK, but they did get a bit flat after a few hours, so I had to use two. \nThe TV reception was sketchy \u2013 most of the lower channels were all snow, and there were not too many to choose from.\nThe bathroom was huge! My bathroom had a large walk-in shower, but no tub. The water pressure was good, and I never ran out of hot water. There was a standard shower head and a rain shower fixture. A colleague was also staying at this hotel, and she had a tub in her bathroom, so it sounds like there are multiple bathroom configurations, too. Shampoo, conditioner and body wash are in a dispenser, and a bar of soap is included for the sink area. Good sized vanity, with lots of space for toiletries, and a lighted makeup mirror. You can get a hair dryer on request.\nI was here for a conference, and I found the hotel staff friendly and helpful, the room clean and well suited for my needs, and the location convenient for everything I needed to do. \nThere is a restaurant at the hotel - The Line & Lariat. It is a really nice restaurant, and the food is very good. Breakfast is great and the service at breakfast was exemplary. Lunch service is at the bar, and was also excellent. I had the crab cakes for lunch and they were really good.\nDiner service, however, leaves a lot to be desired. I was seated promptly by the hostess, who had a bright, beautiful smile, and served me my water right away. 15 minutes later, I had lots of time to peruse the small menu, but I still hadn\u2019t seen a server. While the menu is not large, it does have good variety, with some unusual dishes tossed in. The supervisor finally came over and took my order, apologizing for the waitress who was quite busy. I found this rather strange, as there was a large conference in town, and there were lots of attendees staying at the hotel. You would think they would have made sure their staffing levels were sufficient to properly serve guests. Anyway, I ordered the Bryan Farms chicken, which was delicious. About 15 minutes after my order was taken, my server walked by an introduced herself on the way by. No apology for the slow service, just her name (which I promptly forgot) and that she would take care of me for the rest of the evening. That was the last time I saw her. It took about 20 minutes for my food to arrive, not completely unreasonable, but I was never offered any bread, even though I saw bread baskets on most of the other tables. I was only drinking water, and I had to flag down a bus person and ask before I got my water refreshed. \nAfter dinner, I sat with an empty plate for about 10 minutes before my empty dishes were cleared, again by the supervisor. The supervisor left my table with my dishes, then remembered to return and ask me if I wanted to order desert \u2013 which I did. Serving tables was obviously not this guy\u2019s job, but I have to give him an A for effort \u2013 he really did try. I had some chocolate concoction which was really sweet and very yummy! I never did get a refill of my coffee, even though I sat with an empty cup for about 15 minutes. I finally gave up and got up to leave. I had to ask the hostess to get my bill so I could pay it as I never did see anyone at my table again so I could to ask for it. \nAll in all, food was great, service appears to be somewhat inconsistent.", "author": {"username": "DorisBH", "num_cities": 27, "num_helpful_votes": 24, "num_reviews": 63, "num_type_reviews": 19, "id": "EC5CCE0DCFEF25BCB2D3FE9290D83E4A", "location": "Airdrie, Canada"}, "date_stayed": "September 2012", "offering_id": 283873, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "November 24, 2012", "id": 146108400, "via_mobile": false}

When I called the desk, they couldn't tell me how to fix it, you got it, they'd send a maid up to check it out. All that, for a price that was above average. I have to say though, that the staff was this surreal type of friendly. Like they were programmed with the same friendly responses. Better than being yelled and smirked at I guess? To their defense, the woman who booked the room for me was very accommodating. She got permission for my 60 lb. dog to stay when they usually only accept dogs under 35lbs. Of course there was an additional charge, and restrictions, but was pleased she went the extra step to allow my dog. Nice property all-in-all if you are wanting something with more personality. Absolutely loved that they had a Texas rubber duck waiting for you in the bathroom with some great soaps. The rooms was very cozy and relaxing. The city view was beautiful. The location was great for downtown nightlife and there was a nice park/walking area two blocks away, which my dog loved. I'd stay there again.

I was attending a convention at the nearby George Brown Convention Center.\nThis was my second visit to Houston, and by and large I can see a huge difference. The area around the Convention Center has been cleaned up (and that includes the hotel location). They've planted a park with trees, flowers, a pond and even a tea house. So Houston is definitely moving beyond its image of being a city of heat, dust and ugly concrete. The walk from the hotel to the Convention Center is short, and crosses part of the new park, so overall it feels like being in the same complex. This is a great plus and Houston is a city that is very spread out and where you can easily lose a lot of time travelling, even to places that are supposedly close by.\nThe hotel is also well located for other attractions in Downtown Houston. The main shopping street is just some blocks away (but honestly speaking not all that interesting, so I wouldn't go there). There are a number of neat bars some of the back streets around the hotel so those are well worth popping into. Also around the corner is the Houston Pavillions, a collection of themed restaurants and music bars all in one building. So you'll have no trouble spending your free time when you're here. I also recommend taking a walk around some of the older parts of Houston which are roughly North and West of the hotel. Personally I was impressed by the different architectural and historical styles. Most recommendable is the Gulf Building (also called Morgan Chase Building) which is an architectural landmark (you can go on a tour). They also seem to be cleaning other parts of Houston up as there is quite a lot of building and renovation going on and much of the ugliness there used to be is gone. One down side, and this has definitely increased since last time I was in Houston, is the number of homeless people and beggars roaming the streets, carrying their belongings in big bags. You see them all day but they seems to get more at night. They aren't dangerous or aggressive but it's still a sorry and uncomfortable sight.\nAnother thing I can recommend is taking a ride on the Metro. Despite what it's name suggests this is not a traditional metro with tunnels but a streetcar that runs through the streets of Houston and is an interesting way to see different parts of the city, passing several major parks, green areas, universities and other points of interest, and is also a great venue for people watching.\nThe hotel is quite easy to find. The architecture is a bit nondescript, but difficult to miss nonetheless. The doors were opened for me by a doorman and the receptionist helped me immediately. Besides the hotels and bars I mentioned previously, the hotel has several bars/restaurants of its own. I later tried the one downstairs. Although it was very late at the time (I guess it must have been the early hours of the morning), I was surprised they could still get me something to eat. The choice of drinks was also surprisingly good for a hotel bar and the barman very professional and knowledgeable about it. It was a bit lacking in atmosphere though as most other people there were serious business types and they went to bed quite early.\nThe hotel has a gym and even an outdoor pool but I only had a quick look at those as I didn't have time for more. Especially the pool did look very inviting, so if I ever come back I'll try and spend some time there. My room was higher up. The view from the window was idionymous with what much of Houston is about. In the foreground a massive expanse of derelict land, temporarily used for car parking, further away some buildings that looked as if they were soon to be torn down. I later discovered there are many more places like these. This is the surreal contrast that typifies Houston: Fancy hotels and many modern skyscrapers that are the HQs of multinationals, and right next door derelict plots and ruined buildings. It makes me wonder how the economics of all that works, and why the people who own what must be very expensive land don't do anything with it. \nThe room itself was good but nothing extraordinary. The bed was comfortable though and everything was clean. I didn't check out the minibar, but the ice cubes were filled up every day. Despite being in the middle of Houston, the room was very quiet and I think i slept very well. The bathroom was very tastefully designed, with lots of patterned tiles emanating a warm feeling, making you want to spend a lot of time there.\nI think the rooms have free WiFi, but I didn't get around to testing that. \nAll in all, the hotel was very well run. The staff were good, the hotel was extremely clean and I can find no fault with any part of it. The interior decoration is on the whole tasteful and makes you feel at ease. The location is also good.", "author": {"username": "Andy M", "num_cities": 5, "num_helpful_votes": 15, "num_reviews": 8, "num_type_reviews": 3, "id": "13119ED019F28C84291FF50D2C4C5515", "location": "Zurich, Switzerland"}, "date_stayed": "May 2012", "offering_id": 98952, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "November 5, 2012", "id": 144590752, "via_mobile": false}

The problems I had with the hotel are the same problems many reviewers have noted, which concerns me since they don't appear to be being addressed. I'll start with the cons (problem areas): 1) Check-in in has major issues - I initially attempted to check in at 11 am, there was no room available so they took our bags and told us to come back. They said they would work on getting us a high room as I requested. I ended up getting a room on the 4th floor...not high in my book, but I'm assuming it is the highest they had available. Anyhow, they called at around 4 to let me know my room was ready. We came back in the early evening to check in and that is when things took a turn. Check in was chaotic despite the fact that there was only one other couple checking in at the same time. The young man asked us for our name, handed us our key and that was it. No description of the property or amenities, no maps or questions about why we were visiting, no introduction or mention of the concierge, no offer to help us with our bags, nothing. The whole ordeal was a bit cold and unprofessional. 2) The staff is very young and trendy, which fits the hotel vibe, and always smile, but there is just a warmth that is missing. There also seems to be a real lack of organization. The staff always seem to be running around, but not necessarily helping you when you need it. Out of the three days we were there, a staff member opened the front door for us 1 time. That is unacceptable when I am paying $400 a night. I highly recommend management start instituting stations that people must man at all times instead of running around frantically. A person at the front door at all times and a person at the check-in desk at all times is a must. 3) No closet space. The hotel is trendy, I get it and I've stayed at other hotels with similar concepts, but none with this little storage space. No drawers and only a tiny glass closet space to hang a few item and 4) the bed was ok, definitely not the comfiest I've ever slept in.\nPros: Room was very, very clean and the view of the public library was nice. The minibar in the room was a nice touch since it offered free snacks and non-alcoholic drinks. The room was quiet despite facing 5th avenue.

Second complaint, we needed cabs on several occasions, nobody offered to get us a cab at first, then I remembered this happened twice--after we stood outside for like 5 minutes, someone finally came to help us, but was either at the same time chatting with someone else, or really not trying as hard as I'd like to.

When we arrived, they unfortunately were closed due to heating problems caused by Hurricane Sandy so we had to go elsewhere for our first night. The staff on duty were very apologetic and assisted us in getting to another hotel.\nThankfully, we were able to return on day two, so spent the rest of our trip there. We had booked a Capella room and asked for a high floor. We stayed in room 1401 which was massive......and I mean huge! The bed was six foot wide and was lost in the room. We overlooked Fifth Avenue and the Chrysler Building. The room had a decent sized seating area with a sofa and two armchairs and the bed. There was a dressing room which had two double open wardrobes and drawers. This then lead into a huge marble bathroom, with twin basins and plenty of countertop space. Shower was vast with two shower heads. You honestly have to see this room to appreciate the space. I do not like small hotel rooms and hate when your cases sit in the corner on open view, which serves to remind that you are going home.....no issues here though - suitcases were well hidden from view.\nThe Bar on Fifth has a nice, relaxed atmosphere and has jazz bands playing every night.\nLocation of the hotel is great for going to the various sights of NYC in both lower and midtown Manhattan.\nHad a serious personal issue during stay. Brian Fahey, Concierge Manager, was absolutely fabulous with his assistance. He always made sure that he kept up to date with the situation and it helped me feel a little more relaxed. \nManaged to use the hotel car (a Maserati) a couple of times - nice touch of luxury.\nOur room was right next to the lift shaft but we could not hear any noises. The room is at the end of the corridor with one other room and is a fair distance away from other rooms, so no disruptions from others walking past.\nDid not eat in the hotel (apart from room service late one night, which was good). Plenty of coffee shops, etc nearby for breakfasts.\nThe Nespresso machine and complimentary mini bar (soft beverages) was a nice touch. Have been in plenty of high end hotels which did not have this. There have been some previous comments bout these not being replenished when used but a quick call to Guest Services soon sort that out.\nWould definitely recommend to others and would stay here again on our return.", "author": {"username": "Pauline010", "num_cities": 13, "num_helpful_votes": 25, "num_reviews": 17, "num_type_reviews": 12, "id": "238339A2F15AFC70E42ED9DF7F19E04A", "location": "Aberdeen, UK"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 1776857, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "November 17, 2012", "id": 145595784, "via_mobile": false}

We actually never figured out one of the lights so we just unscrewed the lightbulbs every night. On our second day we requested and received an orientation, which was very helpful, so we could used all of the \"special features\" of the toilet. In case it appears we are completely inept, we are not....the toilet actually had to be reset so that the bidet features would work. But the toilet still malfunctioned twice in our three-day visit so that engineering had to come to reset it. So it was a little too high tech for our tastes. Also, we paid for the terrace, which is completely useless unless you are a smoker. Otherwise you would not want to spend time there since it is close to the HVAC unit so very noisy and no view. Lastly, both bars and the restaurant were completely unavailable beginning at 4pm on one of our nights because the Food Network was using the location.

The breakwast was also light, hence the name \"continental breakfast,\" with a wide variety of pastries, breads, yogurts, etc. The hotel's location was very good, right next to the Waldorf Astoria and a short walk to Saks Fifth Avenue. One negative of this hotel was that the dining portion of the room service was not 24/7, and it was only Indian food. The staff was also extremely kind and welcoming.

Very nice furnishings, clean and well-maintained. 2 big TVs; docking station for iPods. Our low-floor room was great given that the elevators can be slow. I never knew about the laundry room that others have mentioned here; I add that to the list of things the staff couldn't be bothered with telling us. Along with: no parking garage within 10 blocks will let you park overnight over Thanksgiving (we ended up at Lincoln Center 12 blocks away, on a tip from a guy at the 6th garage we tried); even though checkin is at 3pm, that doesn't necessarily mean 3, it might mean 4:30; (because \"it's really busy\" - now I know to only expect what I pay for when it's slow). I know it's been a while since I've been to NY, because I noticed the lack of pleasantries, such as \"good morning\" from a doorman or \"Did you enjoy you stay?\" from the front desk. Ah well. It's a nice place and you'll love it if you want to stay in a quieter part of the city, without being too far away from things. Fairway across the street; Starbucks on the corner; liquor store next door.

Patrick at the front desk gave me an upgrade so that I wouldn't have to wait for my room to be ready, and a $15 free mini-bar card for becoming an In Touch Member. Kevin in Maintenance was also a big help.\n3. The shower is bright and big and has a wonderful rain-shower head as well as a hand-held shower-head. (unfortunately, the floor was very slippery when wet!! Not a good thing)\n4. Beautiful, big, flat screen, high-def TV.\n5. Excellent hair dryer.\n6. Large closet with plenty of hangers, shelves, and a safe. Robes to use if you want.\n7. Big full-length mirror.\nNow the BAD things:\n The room is INSANELY DARK after the sun goes down. I needed my flashlight to unpack my suitcase and to work at the desk. And trying to get them to bring an extra lamp was like pulling teeth!! I had to basically beg many different people, before someone was able to finally find a lamp!\nThere is a nice 8 foot long desk and chair, but the unusual desk light illuminates only a tiny rectangle of space on the desk, leaving the rest of the desk in darkness. Same problem with the night table lamp that just shines directly down on a small area. And the only other lights in the room are two micro-mini recessed ceiling lights over by the window that each shine a narrow, angled beam of light directly onto the curtains. The fact that the majority of the walls are dark brown adds to the problem.\nBelieve me, I'm all for saving electricity, but there are other ways to save electricity. In ACCOR HOTELS for example, the lights will not go on unless you put your room key in a special slot by the door when you enter. So when you go out, and take your key, it is impossible to leave the lights on.\nAs I was looking through the items in the Mini-bar to use my gift card, I noticed that almost all the drinks and food items were expired. And in addition to snacks, the Mini-Bar also had items like a 3-Pack of CONDOMS, and PERSONAL LUBRICANT for sale! I was offended and disgusted! I would expect to see things like that at a seedy motel that you rent by the hour! \nI'm used to reaching into the night table to read the Bible before going to bed (all Hilton Hotels have Bibles).

Outstanding experience!\u201d", "text": "We just returned from our one night mini-vacay from NYC, and I can't wait to write about our experience staying at the San Carlos Hotel. My husband I took our sons, age 3 and 1, to NYC for a weekend trip. We truly enjoyed the hotel from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. There are three main reason why we love it, the room size, hotel amenity and the most important part, staff. My husband and I had stayed in several other hotels in the area in the past, (Affinia, Waldorf Astoria, Hilton New York and Hilton Time Square), but we found this hotel worth returning to. \nFirst of all, the size of the room is beyond expected. It felt more like a \"home\" than a hotel room. For the average price of a mid-town Manhattan hotel, we had a true one-bedroom suite with two queen size beds. The bed room was equipped with a standard size desk and a large flat screen TV. The beds were soft yet supportive. The living room had a sofa bed, two chairs, a large TV, a dining area and a kitchenette. After sitting in the stroller all afternoon waiting for us, my boys were ready for some stretching. The room provided plenty of space for them. If there is any downside to the room, that would be the view out of the window. We didn't care, since we spent most of the time exploring the city. \nThe amenities of the room were great, especially the kitchenette. It has a small refrigerator, sink, microwave, and some basic dinnerware like bowls, plates, glasses and silverware. Don't worry about bringing a cork opener, they got that, too. We brought in dinner for Sat. night, and all the items in the kitchenette made it so much easier. The breakfast was simply, yet every item was delicious. Even coffee was better than Starbucks! \nFinally, and most importantly, I truly enjoy the people that work at San Carlos. The front desk staff were very helpful and paid special attention to each guest. The captain was very accommodating to our requests. The house keeping staff were very friendly. We truly felt welcomed at the hotel. \nOn Sunday morning, my 3-year-old didn't want to go home and wanted to stay in NYC. The whole family found this experience beyond our expectations. We are looking forward to going back soon!", "author": {"username": "Eve B", "num_reviews": 2, "id": "E9022F291A01CDAC24DDF6F16C8DFA96", "location": "Herndon, Virginia, United States", "num_helpful_votes": 3}, "date_stayed": "October 2012", "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 3, "date": "October 7, 2012", "id": 142253553, "via_mobile": false}

We had a 12th floor executive suite facing 50th avenue, from 13 to 19 September.\nHotel location is OK, many restaurants at walking distance, 2 blocks away from subway station, lots of groceries stores nearby, friendly reception staff. Housekeeping is efficient. Free internet access, I could use two devices simultaneously under the same login. No room service.\nThe suite is large is disposes of kitchenette with microwave and fridge, although a toaster would have come in handy. It is quite comfortable for two people, with plenty of drawers and storing space, sofa and a small dining table with two chairs. Beware of the touch-sensitive mini-bar, unless you really want to pick up something. There are 2 large flat screen TV sets, but the program grid is limited to US channels: no French, German or Italian channel, which could add an international flair to the property. The bathroom has magnifying mirror, towels of good standard, satisfactory but not high-end toiletries. \nBed is comfortable, there is a good choice of pillows, but sleep quality was greatly disturbed by persistent air-borne noise. The windows are definitely not soundproof (the site call them \"double-glazed\"), and every kind of street noise seemed to pour into the room, from shouts and whistles late at night, to police and fire sirens all night long and delivery trucks early in the morning.\nBreakfast was better than I had expected from previous reviews. It is the usual continental type, and one would not pay less than 13 euros for it in a Parisian hotel; we would complement it upstairs with some fresh fruit bought the evening before. The breakfast room is really cramped, although that is a minor problem if you are on vacation and can manage your time schedule avoiding breakfast at peak times.\nThe San Carlos is a nice and affordable hotel in NY, adequate for a short stay and particularly suited for families with children.", "author": {"username": "Gabriel C", "num_cities": 13, "num_helpful_votes": 21, "num_reviews": 15, "num_type_reviews": 15, "id": "9B330AB13A6C8D282E82CD1BEC042156", "location": "Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"}, "date_stayed": "September 2012", "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "September 22, 2012", "id": 140920753, "via_mobile": false}

I agree with a previous reviewer, I did not want to leave and joked with the front desk I would call a real estate agent! Well, the Sherry does indeed have one, and her name is Theresa Nocerino. If you are in the market for a pied a terre, be sure to give her a call. Everyone at the hotel and in Cipriani's just raved about her.

It's in an area adjacent to I-45, just a few blocks from the edge of the downtown office towers. About a 4 block walk. But that 4 block walk, and however many more to your destination within downtown, can be brutal during the searingly hot and humid period between early June and late September. It's location is immediately adjacent to Freedman's Town in the 4th ward, an area just beginning to transition from old, delapidated wooden homes and bad street surfaces to \"gentrification\". Walking some of the streets late night might not be prudent. There is a secure parking area to the front and the rear of the property.\nAll of the rooms are suite-sized, much larger than is typical. Lots of room. Room decor is a step up from the usual blandness of most hotels, quite attractive. The room and bath were super clean. Carpet is just a bit frayed though. The beds are very comfy and soft, which I prefer. Some don't. Had a very nice white comforter, not one of those nasty bedspread things.\nThere's a microwave and refrigerator in each room. And a 42\" HDTV. BUT... no HDTV service. Go figure. They spent more than is normal in designing and furnishing the rooms, then won't bother to pay for HDTV service.\nThe bath was very clean, but average in size and design. The towels were excellent, very fluffy. BUT... no exhaust vent. Why do so many mid-to-upscale hotels not install bathroom exhaust vents?\nThe air conditioner was very efficient and quick in establishing whatever temperature we set it for. And was very quiet in doing so. Had an excellent nights sleep. \nThere's a nice pool, but it's situated a bit oddly. Most of the pool and surrounding lounging area are under the hotel's second floor, with no sun access. There is one small area at one end of the pool that does get sun from midday until early evening.\nThere is an excellent full breakfast. Which is fortunate since there's no nearby dining or shopping places.\nAll in all, a very good place to sleep well near downtown, but it's very overpriced. After all, it's just a Best Western Plus. For the same price or a few bucks more a room can be booked at nearby hotels that are actually within downtown such as the Doubletree.", "author": {"username": "xplorers2", "num_cities": 16, "num_helpful_votes": 14, "num_reviews": 20, "num_type_reviews": 17, "id": "E71C97C29E8706B074C79CB58EE63D3D", "location": "Spring, TX"}, "date_stayed": "June 2012", "offering_id": 239853, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "June 4, 2012", "id": 131281559, "via_mobile": false}

The garage is on the left-hand side of the building if you're facing the hotel. The garage feels a little sketchy.

It had been a few years since our last stay and apparently it had become more popular since then because of all the good reviews. I guess it is a hidden gem no more! My grown daughters say that they will stay no where else when they are in New York City. Once again, the San Carlos did not disappoint.\nWhen we arrived, Gabriel (I think-no name tags) at the desk immediately greeted us with humor. Since it was my husband with me and our two daughters, he referred to my husband as \"Charlie\" the entire time and we were the \"angels\". We had booked a standard two queen bed room but Gabriel said that we were in a king room suite with a small kitchen at the same rate. I asked about the bed situation and he said that if my daughters were unhappy with the sofabed that we could switch. He assured them that the matresses were new and comfortable. \nOur suite was very spacious and we loved the kitchen area. We seemed to be facing out to a street but it was very quiet in our room. Besides the kitchen space, we had a little table and chairs area, two closets, a desk, two comfortable cushy chairs and a big screen TV plus the king bed! So nice for NYC. And my daughters never had a single complaint about the sofabed. I always especially like the real plants in the room and the roman shades. It seems to give such a homey touch. The bathroom was also spacious with robes, toiletries, plenty of towels and a makeup mirror, etc. We couldn't think of anything they didn't provide. \nEveryone as usual was very pleasant and friendly, always greeting us when we came and went. My husband was especially pleased with how quick the bellman got our luggage up to our room-even before we left the front desk. He had to track him down to give him his tip. We saw the umbrellas lined up as usual on a rainy day but we had our own. Everyone always provided help with our questions when asked. My husband enjoys the fact that he can set up transportation to and from the airport through the San Carlos before our trip. I love the scale in the lobby to weigh your suitcases before your flight-which they do for you if you want! I travel a lot and don't see a scale very often in a hotel lobby. A nice touch since I always want to know what mine weigh before I get to the airport.\nWe love the San Carlos for its amenities and spaciousness but also for its location to 5th Ave. (a few blocks walk straight up) and the subway lines (right on the corner). We also found a great Mexican restaurant on the next block behind the hotel. Yes, the breakfast is a little lacking in variety but that doesn't bother us because we are getting FREE breakfast in NYC!!\nWhen we left, Gabriel joked with us once more and gave us free pens to take. We noticed a small boy coming in after us and he immediately started to show him a magic trick. We had to laugh! The San Carlos always makes us feel welcome and like we are part of the family returning for a visit.

No noise from lifts or other rooms despite hotel being full. Its not trendy - its conservative and a little old fashioned but in a good comfortable way with great linen and bathrooms as well.\nThe location is great - two blocks to the madness of Time Square and then you can retreat to this haven - or walk the other direction straight onto the shopping mecca of 5th avenue. 10 minute walk to Empire State.

The morning after the storm when Manhattan was closed down literally and shut off from the rest of NYC, the hotel laid on complimentary breakfast for all guests, they provided up to the minute information from airlines about flight cancellations, they made pots of coffee for guests in the lobby trying to use the internet, and despite having to sleep at work, the doormen handed out umbrellas with a smile and up to date information about what was operating or open when it was hard to find places to eat.\nWe must mention the fabulous and friendly concierge Vanessa who was always smiling and knowledgable and sorted out anything guests asked her to including spending over an hour on the phone (helping other customers whilst she was on hold I might add!) to an airline for us trying to change our flights due to cancellations. \nPatrick on the front desk kept his cool when faced with tired and emotional customers and was always helpful. Hotel management did the human spirited thing and made the very generous decision to allow all guests to stay on at a flat rate which was below their usual rate (unlike other operational hotels in NYC after the storm) and also to cancel additional nights up until 2pm if guests found they could actually travel out of NYC.\nAMAZING.

What he actually sent me were vouchers for continental breakfast which is of a lower value. I had to call again to set this issue clear and finally get the correct vouchers. Unlike other hotels were they offer the most generous breakfasts at the Setai they are extremely stingy. Full breakfast to them is 2 eggs, 1 sausage, coffee and 1 Juice. For anything else you get charged extra. The free wifi is extremely slow we paid the 15 dollar extra per day. They have all the disney channels apart from Disney Junior, so that they can charge 3.99 or something for 30 minute shows for pre-schoolers. We were never told of the courtesy car they have - they never offered it to us. The room was not being cleaned thoroughly. They change sheets every 3 days. My son had smudged the floor to ceiling mirror in the closet area, those smudges stayed there for 3 days.

I chose this hotel because it is branded as a five stars hotel, because of the flexible check-in and checkout times and finally because of the good reviews on this website. Unfortunately, even though there were positives during my stay at the Setai, it did not reach my expectations for many reasons.\nI\u2019ll start with the negatives.\nFirst, they pretend on their website that the hotel has flexible check-in and checkout times. In the hotel\u2019s guide inside my suite, it\u2019s also clearly written that \u00abthere\u2019s no check in and checkout times at the Setai\u00bb and that guests can request a late checkout for their date of departure. Unfortunately, this is not true. I booked this hotel for this reason because I was landing in New-York in early afternoon and leaving in the evening and I didn\u2019t want to wait hours at the hotel bar to wait for check in. Well, that\u2019s exactly what happened. I arrived at the hotel just before 1h00PM and they told me at the reception I had to wait until 2h30PM for my suite to be ready. No excuses, no upgrades. At 2h15, the front desk clerk reached me at the bar to tell me my suite was ready. That was a nice touch, but I was expecting my room to be ready when I arrived. Same story for checking out. I asked the front desk the day before my departure for a late checkout. They asked me what time, and when I said 6h00PM, they said it was impossible and the best they could do for me was 2h00PM. That\u2019s unacceptable from a hotel that clearly claims they have no check-in and checkout times.\nThe other negative is that I requested at the time of booking a high floor because I always like to have nice views when I book hotels. They gave me the 19th floor. I could say it is a high floor, but not in this case since their website says the hotel\u2019s one bedroom suites are located between 18th and 27th floor. \nThe third negative is the service in the room. For example, there was a lack in maid service. There were spots of dirt left after the daily maid service. Also, coffees and milks for the espresso machine were not refilled. So I had to call for a refill and it took more than half an hour to have someone come to my room even though they said someone was coming \u00abright now\u00bb. Same thing for the laundry service, the person at the phone said someone was already on her way to pick up my clothes but it took more than 15 minutes to have someone knock on my door. This same person asked me when I needed my clothes back and when I said for the next morning before 10h00AM, they replied \u00abno problems they will be in your room before 10\u00bb. They gave me back my clothes at 10h45AM without warning me they would arrive late.\nThese are some of the small details that, alone, are not that bad. But, put together, they leave a poor impression. It is unacceptable from a five star hotel who ask their clients more than 1300$/night to stay in the type of suite I had.\nNow, the positives.\nFirst, the in-room dining. Although expensive, everything from the presentation to the quality of the meal was perfect.\nWhen I needed transportation to go downtown, I asked if the chauffeured Maserati was available and it was. What an experience! The driver, I forgot his name, knows how to ride this sport car. He will get you to your destination in a very short time and don't be afraid, he is a very good driver.\nAlso, despite the erratic service I already mentioned above, the staff is, for the majority, exceptionally friendly. They will always smile, say hello and, when they remember, they will greet you by your name. \nConcerning the accommodation, the one-bedroom suite I had was very nice. It was nicely decorated and very spacious. These suites are equipped with washer/dryer, fridge, microwave, oven, etc. It really feels like you are at home. Also, the TV in the bathroom is a nice touch. \nIn conclusion, I would have given this hotel 3.5 stars. But since I can\u2019t give a half star, I give the Setai 4 stars because that\u2019s the number this hotel should have in reality. A 5 stars hotel is, in my opinion, close to perfection. Unfortunately, the Setai Fifth Avenue failed in many departments as stated above. It is still a very good hotel, but it costs too much for what you get in return.\nFor all these reasons, I do not think I will come back at this hotel. I\u2019m ready to pay a lot a money for service but I expect to get what I pay for which was not the case at the Setai. For the same price, next time I\u2019ll try the Trump International hotel or the Mandarin Oriental.", "author": {"username": "Thierry2488", "num_cities": 7, "num_helpful_votes": 15, "num_reviews": 10, "num_type_reviews": 6, "id": "11FC891BD59DDB16C738F1CF3D71E3AD", "location": "Montreal, Canada"}, "date_stayed": "October 2012", "offering_id": 1776857, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "October 27, 2012", "id": 143878689, "via_mobile": false}

The lobby area was quite large with a seating area/library off to one side and restaurant to the other. A few minutes later we were taken to our allocated room and shown all the amenities the room had to offer. Our room was on the 7th floor, (an XL King with view) and we had a lovely view of the library and 42nd Street. The bed was really comfortable, our son had a rollaway bed which was also comfortable. The bedroom was a good size and had a large 42inch flatscreen TV, sofa, mini fridge with complimentary snacks and non alcoholic drinks, safety deposit box, a small glass wardrobe, bedside drawers, iron & ironing board and desk with a telephone. There was a touchpad control for the lights and window blind, which was straight forward to use. It would have been handy if there was a mirror over the desk as the only other mirror in the room was next to the glass wardrobe in the entrance. It was mentioned in previous reviews about noise from the road outside, the only thing we could just about hear was the sound of police/fire engine sirens.\nThe bathroom was lovely, it had twin sinks, the shower area had a rain shower, normal shower and footbath. We managed to work out the controls for each one after a couple of goes. There was also a hairdryer and toiletries. The only thing I would suggest to change in the bathroom is the lighting, it was rather dim. Other than that the bathroom was very modern, clean and towels changed every day.\nBecause of hurricane Sandy the hotel issued us with a torch and glow sticks and offered us complimentary pay per view films/TV. We were expecting the power to fail, but fortunately the hotel was not affected (1 block away was in complete darkness)We were kept informed at all times by staff. When we were told our return flight was cancelled I contacted reception who extended our stay straight away and offered assistance contacting my airline. We met with other guests in the seating/library area of an evening, swapping stories over our glasses of complimentary wine (Ramone was the best 'host'). It is a nice touch that the hotel offers this between 6pm and 9pm each evening.\nWe used the restaurant for breakfast as everywhere else was closed due to Sandy. The eggs, bacon and hash brown was very nice and staff very attentive.\nThe Andaz 5th Ave is right in the middle of all the tourist areas, 5 mins in each direction to Grand Central Station, Time Square, Empire State Building and shopping on 5th Ave.\nThis was our 2nd trip to New York, 1st time at Andaz.

Another fun feature is that the room is operated entirely by touch, not traditional light switches.

We wanted to stay in an area that had a more local neighbourhood feeling so we thought the Upper West Side would do the trick. I was really impressed by the value of this hotel. With the tax we paid $344 a night for a King room. Other hotels I researched were even more then that and the pictures didn\u2019t seem as nice. We got there late at night and there was a big crowd in the lobby and low and behold Robin Williams was there visiting with fans. I assumed he was performing at the theatre next door but not sure. Seemed like a sign of a good visit. The room was very large. Much bigger then other New York hotels I\u2019ve stayed in. As well the d\u00e9cor was really nice and bed very comfortable. It definitely seemed like they had renovated recently. Before our arrival I emailed to request a quiet room on a higher floor. They gave us a room on the top floor which is 25th. Our room was across from the elevators which I thought might be a problem for noise but we barely heard anything from the hallway. As well I had read reviews about the elevators being slow but we never had an issues with them. We had chatted with some local residences of the hotel that had been living there for 25 years. It was interesting to stay in a place with such history. When we woke up our first morning we were stunned at the view. A great way to start everyday. \nThe subway is right around the corner which is really convenient. At the last minute I considered switching hotels to somewhere around Greenwich Village because I thought that we might be spending hours on the subway but the express train to Time Square is super fast. We would be downtown in around 15 minutes so getting around wasn\u2019t a problem at all. \nHaving the Viand Caf\u00e9 downstairs is really convenient as well. We arrived late at night and it was so nice to pop down for a snack and drink. On our last day we had to leave for our flight early so again it was nice to have a reasonably priced meal downstairs. We also had breakfast at Le Pain Quotiden on 72nd which we really enjoyed as well we went to Sarabeth\u2019s West which was good but nothing really special and pricey. We also partook in the famous Gray\u2019s Papaya for a snack too. A really nice wine store is just downstairs too and a Duane Reade closeby if you forgot any toiletries. \nThere\u2019s lots of shopping around the area too which we didn\u2019t expect which was great. A big DSW was just down the street. We rented bikes at Master Bike Shop on 72nd and did a nice ride around Central Park. \nFor the beautiful room, view, location, and value I\u2019d definitely recommend the Beacon.", "author": {"username": "unplainjane", "num_cities": 49, "num_helpful_votes": 111, "num_reviews": 68, "num_type_reviews": 51, "id": "1005ABAA83773778AB2A4BAAFE443901", "location": "toronto"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 3, "date": "November 14, 2012", "id": 145419124, "via_mobile": false}

It was quite clean and had good space, a nice sized closet, including a nook with a fridge for my own groceries as well as a mini bar. The bed was comfortable. A clock radio that will charge your iphone with plenty of plugs to recharge your electronics. I liked my room quite a bit. The front desk staff was kind and very helpful. They allowed me to check in early, and store my luggage on the day of departure. The doormen did a wonderful job helping with taxis and offering advice. However, they can not overcome everything.\nI had 2 significant problems during my stay. One was the noise in the hotel. Two was the lack of any civilized dining, as well as no room service at all.\nThe doors in the hotel slam. So between rowdy guests coming and going at all hours and the morning housekeeping staff hollering down the halls, sleeping at 10 pm or 8 am was just not possible. The walls are thin and I could hear the televisions of neighboring rooms. Believe me, I am accustomed to NYC noise and not much gets to me. The noise at the San Carlos was just overwhelming, not just annoying. I was there 5 nights, and guests cam and went, but the noise level did not change. Such a disappointment.\nHowever, the thing I hated more was the breakfast service in a cramped dark hot room. Breakfast, which was limited to bad bagels, toast, a couple of varieties of cereal and coffee was a chaotic mess. Tiny paper plates, cheap plastic knives that break, and tiny coffee cups that are too hot to carry was a horrible way to begin my day. Everything was disposable and unpleasant. Honestly, the airlines do better. I stayed there five days and not one morning could I easily grab a cup of coffee and take a seat. Just a mess. Don't even think about requesting a coffee service to be delivered to your room either. Other midtown hotels have self serve breakfast, and it works. The key is space, good variety, and enough staff to keep the place clean, well stocked, and to provide assistance. Actual glassware, plates, and utensils would be nice. This just is the worst.\nThe San Carlos has the potential to be a good hotel. I wish I wanted to return. I wanted to like it very much.

We were very happy with our 'home' for 3 nights. The location was also easy access to Penn St Station, Madison Square Gardens, Macy's etc - easy walking distance to most sights but not as noisy an area as Times Square, etc.\nWe arrived pretty late on the first night so just went into the hotel bar for a quick drink and bar snack upon arrival. It has a nice ambience though the drinks were a little pricey (it is a hotel in Manhattan afterall!)\nThe hotel also does some nice touches for guests - inclusive continental breakfast which was very good - fresh juices, tea & coffee, wide choice of fresh fruits, pastries, cereals, breads, cheese & meats. You can choose hot buffet items for an additionsl 12 dollars or choose from the menu. We found the continental breakfast was plenty for us and breakfast is served in a light & airy conservatory.\nThey also provide free wine hour from 5pm-6pm, again very welcome after a long day sightseeing.\nWhen you need to check in online for your flights home, you can go to the business centre and use their PC to check in and print out your boarding card for free. That was a great, hassle-free service that meant we weren't waiting on busy staff to help us do this.\nWe signed up to the Kimpton InTouch membership before we visited - simply join online for free and you get perks such as free wifi and a voucher for free drinks from the minibar.\nI think I've previously read complaints about maids walking into the room when guests are still in there but that didn't happen with us. There isn't a 'do not disturb' sign to hang on the outside of the door; it's a light switch change next to the door. If the room is empty then the light is orange; if you don't want to be disturbed then flick the switch and it changes to red, telling the maids not to enter.

I was really excited about staying at this five star hotel that has received many great reviews. Our last stay was at Sofitel, and I absolutely loved the service (held your bags, doorman became my friend, gorgeous suite)- Sofitel clearly understands five-star service. The Setai, in my standards, could not deliver when it came to friendly service and hospitality. The concierage did not go out of their way, and the doormen acted more like security guards. The only employee in Setai that actually knew the meaning of real quality five-star service was Brett. Thank you, Brett :) The rest should learn from him!\nHere is a breakdown of the Positives and Negatives:\n- gave us a room right away as soon as we landed, so easy early check in\n- became obsessed with the espresso machine! But, housekeeper was so cheap on providing extra pods\n- good location if you are into midtown/Times Square, personally, next time we want to be closer to Central Park \n- Gym had good equipment, but dark paint on walls and no windows may be a hard environment for some to work out in, and what's up with the old, bruised fruit?\n- the room service was nice and quick (Sheniqua was a friendly voice on the other end)\n- free shoe shine and ironing\n- even though I was not happy with the hotel, the room itself was great. Our deluxe king room and bathroom was spacious and nice\n- mini-fridge\n- hotel car, if you can get it, is a maserati\n- be careful, since the location is right on fifth ave, lower level room occupants might be able to hear the busy street, we were on floor 15, but I could still hear the hustle and bustle outside from the bathroom only not the room\n******* Oh, the icing on the cake, the housekeeper threw away my take-out twice! The first time, grrr, I let it go, but then the next day, my Mario Batali pizza that was not even placed near a garbage was also \"cleaned up\".

The Setai is the first one that hits on that metric.\nFirst off, the location is convenient to both Penn and Grand Central Stations, being only a few blocks walk from each. Close to the E Subway (from JFK) as well. SO far, so good.\nRoom was huge, and well stocked with water, sodas and Nespresso, all of which are included. It's not cheap by any means, but in NY nothing is, and the hotels we have tried in the $250-$350 range have generally been old, run down places with noisy (and largely non-functional) HVAC. The air system in the room at the Setai got a good amount of chill into the room, and did so quietly. Bravo!\nTraffic noise was very muted, with is saying something for NY, the city that never sleeps and never stops blowing the horn on the taxi. The only noise issue was that the doors do not have any kind of damper on the closing/hinge, so if the guest doesn't bother to close the door gently, it slams. That was not an issue on Thursday or Friday of our stay, but Saturday apparently some of the guests on the floor partied late (3-4 am) and then came back too inebriated to bother keeping the noise level down. That interrupted sleep numerous times because of the banging of the doors. Management please take note. Put door closers on the guest rooms, so that the door will close gently and quietly.\nFood was expensive but good. Fortunately, my wife is a member of the Leading Hotels program, so we got a $70 breakfast credit daily. That sounds like a lot, but it is about what breakfast for two costs.

I moved out of NY a year ago, and miss it terribly. I wanted to be right back where I used to live. I was a little hesitant about the Beacon, because I had been in there years ago. And I mean over 20 years ago, and it wasn't very nice. But it has REALLY changed!!! It's VERY nice!!! Let me break it down from the big picture to the small details.\nLocation: Perfect for me. I love the Upper West Side. I spend most of my time in Central Park (walking, photographing, running, bird watching, people watching, going to the zoo, bike riding, exploring, etc). My goal when I lived in NY was to live as close to Fairway (a unique grocery store) as humanly possible. The Beacon is right across the street. And the Beacon has kitchens in each room, so I actually did buy food at Fairway and prepared it in my room. But back to the location description. 75th and Broadway is the epicenter of 3 amazing cupcake shops, a famous bakery, Fairway, Zabars, Juice Generation (great smoohties), Harry's Burritos, Big Nicks, Shake Shack, the Park, three excellent gyms and a couple great yoga places. If your vacation plans don't revolve around food and exercise, you'll think that list was strange. But for me, it was perfect. It was like being home. I should also mention Lincoln Center and the Natural History museum are very close by. All the museums on the East Side are walkable through the park. If you're more into the downtown scene/night life or Broadway, maybe it's not for you. But hey, the subway is RIGHT THERE, so transportation is convenient.\nHotel: The lobby, staff, elevators were all superior for a non-brand hotel.\nHallways: Carpeted, fairly quiet, wide and clean.\nRooms. Bright, clean, newly remodeled, spacious, welcoming, pleasing finishes, comfortable. Each room (as far as I know) has a kitchen (with dishes/pots and pans),a safe, tv, free wifi, extra blankets, good toiletries, ironing board, luggage rack, comfortable beds and pillows. Our room was amazing. It was room 2112, on the 21st floor. It was a corner room with a view I could NOT keep my eyes off of. One window faced Central Park and the East side. One faced downtown. We had views of Times Square, The Chrysler Building, Broadway (the street) and the Ansonia-which is a gorgeous building, and on the East, views of some of my very favorite architecture (the San Remo!), Citicorp, the Sherry Netherland and that glorious Park. We slept with the blinds open. We watched the sun rise over the buildings, We couldn't stop looking or taking pictures. I had lived in NY 10 years, in many apartments, and I never had a view like that. \nBTW there were also windows in the kitchen and Bathroom.The one in the bathroom opened.\nI will ALWAYS stay at this hotel when I'm in NY.

The valet staff were very prompt and friendly, so I do want to give special thanks to them because they made a wonderful first impression. \nThe lobby is nice. There is something very retro about the chandeliers, but it somehow works. Overall, I would say the lobby is quite impressive and in line with the purported star rating of the hotel. The exterior, however, is very very 70's. There is absolutely nothing they can do about that, but you cannot help but notice it.\nThe desk clerk was quite pleasant. I cannot remember her name, but as with most people at the hotel, if you were interacting with them in person, they delivered top-notch service. My biggest complaint about the service, and it is a big one, is that they NEVER answer the phone promptly. I literally would let the phone ring 30+ times, still with no answer. So then I would try housekeeping, the concierge, room service, anybody...same thing. For a five-star hotel, it is pretty unacceptable for this to occur. One time - sure; things happen. This problem, however, existed throughout my entire stay. \nAs others have noted, there are certain elements that make the hotel appear quite dated. The elevators are ancient and should definitely be at the top of the list for upcoming renovations. The tracks on the drapes in the room were also quite old. The rooms were pleasant, but not extraordinary. I had to switch rooms, however, because the first one had a very awful musty smell. We were then moved to a room on the level with the pool. It was okay, but it felt very dark. Also, the pool area looked a bit worse for wear. I can imagine how luxurious this place must have been in its prime, but that prime has certainly passed. \nOne thing that I find absolutely unforgiveable about this hotel, though, is the ice machine room. They need to remove all signage relating to the ice machine and make guests call to have ice delivered. I had the misfortune of going to fetch my own ice, and I walked into a room that was filthy, covered in trash and clearly (hopefully) not meant to be seen by guests. I was so shocked. For any hotel above 1 star, I would expect more.\nThe location is great, and you are able to get out of the city quickly, but I was surprised at how dead Houston is at night. Clearly, this has nothing to do with the hotel, so I am not trying to make any connection there; I was just surprised. I would think it might be wiser to stay near the Galleria if you are looking for something other than just a business stay.\nAll in all, the stay was \"ok\"; nothing really wow'ed me about this place, so I guess that disappoints me, but I tend to find that to be the case with Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton properties.

Thoughts :\n-great location. On W44th between 5th and 6th, a couple of blocks from Grand Central Station and a few mins walk from Times Square, but W44th is not the noisiest street so good from that perspective\n-boutique feel. It's small in NYC hotel terms, and perhaps lacks some of the facilities as a result, but is also friendlier than many. Staff are great.\n-the room I had was inward facing and had no view at all (a wall obscured part of the window - could not even tell what the weather was like - seriously). However, this also meant the room was quiet - not always the case in NYC\n-room was pretty small. Was fine for me travelling solo but would've been cramped if shared. I don't know if this was typical of rooms in the hotel but I suspect it was\n-room was otherwise v nice. Quality fittings, nice linen, new-looking bathroom with good shower and Molton Brown toiletries, with a small desk and HD TV and a mini bar in the room\n-wifi is free in this hotel which isn't all that common in NYC - could save you $20/day\n-room service menu is very limited, although food (from Triomphe, the French Restaurant at Ground Level) is of good quality and the service was quick when I ordered.

{"ratings": {"overall": 4.0}, "title": "\u201cGreat location, would stay again, but...\u201d", "text": "Just finished a long weekend stay at the Andaz. Prefer to stay at Hyatts for reward status, and now have stayed in all Of the Hyatts in Manhattan. Observations:\n1) Check-in was a mess. The Andaz philosophy of iPads around a central desk area without a formal checkin desk can be hectic when busy, but there wasn't any line. Stood for a minute with no assistance, eventually an associate looked up from computer screen to see us, but then helped a guest who had a question, who showed up at desk after we arrived. Associate who checked us in informed us our room wasn't ready, acknowledged our Gold Passport status, took our cell phone #, took our bags. Was told at checkin something about 'I'm checking to see what the best room we have available is', and then told quickly before whisking our bags away that 'we have a King room available for you'- same category booked. If no upgrades available, I understand, but don't treat the category booked as a favor. \n2) No perfect location in Manhattan as you may prefer both uptown and downtown locations, but hotel is almost in perfect spot. Easy access to Grand Central and 4/5/6 line uptown or downtown, easy walking distance to all midtown locations. Difficult to get a taxi during weekday business hours, there is no dedicated cab stand for hotel. Saw our associate outside the hotel when returning from unsuccessfully trying to hail a cab on 5th Ave, he offered to wait on 5th to hail a taxi, we laughed and said that wouldn't be necessary.\n3) Received ph call that room was ready about 10min after checkin. Room was right across elevator-- normally not a fan of this at all but hotel was very quiet during stay, no noise issues. \n4) Room is spartan, no wall ornaments/pictures but I don't mind this, not staying for artwork. Large desk with plenty of outlets, one large outside window with automated blind coverage, large cream couch for lounging/clothes, comfy bed. Plenty of room for luggage.\n5) Fridge well stocked, I suspect most adults won't drink the fruit soda, there is room in the fridge for your own beverages if you move things around/out. The food is a bag of pretty good potato chips, two ok chocolate squares, and an incredibly salty granola bar.\n6) TV has a lot of interactive/smart features but only a smattering of HD channels, not an issue for me but if you are watching a lot of TV in your room it is a bit puzzling.\n7) Bathroom is poorly designed. Two sinks, plenty of space, but two extremely bad design choices. First, no door separating toilet from rest of bathroom. I am not a fan of modern/Mandarin Oriental-like open or exposed bathroom spaces, and not having a separate WC is really not negotiable, esp for those guests sharing a room who aren't involved. Second, the shower stall is really poorly designed. The glass partition, like in lots of European hotels, doesn't extend far enough to stop splashing into the rest of the bathroom. The shower is a rainshower head with high ceilings, I'm not that tall or large but there is no way to stop water from splashing over and on to the small ledge separating the stall from the rest of the bathroom floor, you have to wipe the ledge mult times during the shower to control the water from spreading. In addition the corner between the glass partition and the back wall of the shower has at least a 1/3 inch gap between them, so water splashes through that gap and in the corner behind the sinks. More wiping down, and that area has already started to have discoloration and wear of the tile and grout. It's inconvenient, and adds to maintenance costs, and will eventually require renovation before it was necessary. Hyatt must spend millions on new room prototypes- I don't understand how this wasn't recognized as a problem. The Andaz Wall Street has similar shower sizes but not the same problems.\n8) Good coffee service in the lobby. Some fruit in baskets but no other snackies. Good selection of papers.\n9) Didn't go to gym or spa. No room service ordered.\n10) Went to restaurant for Sunday breakfast. Priced similarly to other hotel restaurants. Crowded, had a wait for a table. Breakfast was excellent, recommend the mini brats.\nProb the first choice for Hyatts in Manhattan because of location. I think the Andaz Wall Street has nicer rooms, service, restaurant, 48 Lex comparable in quality for usually less money. Will see what the anticipated Park Hyatt brings. Overall would stay again.\nContact me for any questions.

It has a Cafe. I had been at this same hotel last year and frankly, the service was terrible. I and my friend waited 20 minutes for a waiter to come around..completely mind blowing. Especially for a Hilton. This year, I'm pleasantly surprised. The crew of the Cafe, beginning with Juan A. Gererro, Cafe supervisor, Yulia Putnam, Beverage and Food, from St. Petersburg, Russia and our incredible waiter, Yorbel, from Kazakhstan, turned this situation around. What a lovely shock! I love Hilton's because they truly are a UN, bringing people from all parts of the world together. Yorbel was a treasure. He is intelligent, personable, a really good hearted person. Yorbel is in his\n3rd year of accounting at the University here in Houston. Further, he's already passed his first CPA of three. He's one of those people who is going to go FAR in life, be very successful. He's a waiter at the Cafe and what ashamed...his talents are so much more. I hope Hilton will consider him for a position in Accounting and utilize all of him, instead of a tiny part of him. Needless to say, we came back for lunch nearly every day and were given swift, prompt service with a genuine and sincere smile. Honestly, it felt like a family was welcoming us. And that's why I'm taking the time to put this on TripAdvisor. It was an incredible experience. Beyond the norm. The Hilton management has really chosen fine people in a service industry that sometimes falls very short. The food quality was never a question. It is excellent, served hot and is creative. Our favorites were the Tortilla soup, the crab cakes and the quesadilla. Dinners were always hot and delicious. My particular favorite was a caesar salad with slices of flatiron steak on it. We had room service, which has always been speedy--20 minutes after the phone call. The food arrived hot. I'll be coming back to the Hilton Americas next fall for the IQA, international Quilt Association, show. And I'm really looking forward to eating in the Cafe again, instead of dreading it as I did in 2011. Thank you, Juan, Julia and Yorbel.

When we woke up the first morning, it was fantastic to open the blinds to see New York city in all its urban glory. It was really exciting and we could not wait to get going. As soon as you step out, you are right in the centre of everything you came to New York for.\nWe understand the beds are new since a year and we slept like babies which was fantastic because we suffered no jet lag (from UK) and I was found I was sleeping for 10 hours! (unheard of). Not only are the windows sound proofed but the hotel is in a quiet zone where traffic must resist honking and beeping at certain times of the night. For the 4 nights we were guests, we did not hear a single sound from the corridors either last thing at night or early morning which is highly unusual. Probably the best sleep I have had overseas.\nWe had a kitchenette which is ok - one can knock up a bit of breakfast but nothing too complicated. There is no worktop space and about 3 cooking utensils with enough cutlery for 2 people. The fridge is great for fruit, eggs and juice. A coffee machine is provided and a kettle.\nEverything worked like clockwork. The only comment would be that I missed having a bar, a communal area to fall into after a long day's walking the great streets and sights of Manhatten. Loved to have come back for a cocktail and communal chat with other residents, etc. \nThe hotel is billed as a 3 star but we can categorically say the bedrooms are 4 star.

The infinity pool on the 18th floor was nice but we didn't try it out due to the rainy weather and LOTS of people. The view is very nice! The pool is heated so it could be used most of the year. The section of the 18th floor where the pool is located is covered but open on the sides to the elements. The 24 Grille, located in the lobby is a little expensive but comparable to other hotels. I recommend the Orange Blueberry Pancakes for breakfast. Yum! This Westin provides a free shuttle to nearby businesses and restaurants. They do charge for parking so the free shuttle is the way to go. CityCentre is about 15 minutes away and a great place to meet friends, shop and eat out.

The manager took care of this issue, as we were clearly un-happy with this. The following morning's breakfast was very week....at best.

Prices were jacked up by $50 a night after the storm (supposedly because of the Marathon). The TV system throughout the hotel was brushed off and our problems were only addressed when we pointed out that we were not 1 or two night guests but in fact there for weeks.

We had a very comfortable and spacious room on the 25th floor, with a small kitchenette, fridge etc useful for preparing breakfast. There is no restaurant or bar at this hotel but there are plenty of both within a short walking distance. We can recommend Viand next door to the hotel for breakfast and 'Citrus', an excellent Thai restaurant just round the corner (great sushi). There is a huge Fairway supermarket across the road and an amazing (if expensive) delicatessan next door to that. Central Park is 2 blocks away, it takes about 20 minutes walking briskly.

With so many choices, it should be easy to find a myriad of properties that suit any number of requirements. But for me, it was a struggle to find the perfect location, level of amenities, and acceptable price point for a recent 4-day trip w/ my hubby.\u00a0\nI ruled out the overpriced hipster boutiques, the stuffy landmarks, the dinosaur properties, the tourist-laden chains, and the too-good-to-be true rates in less desirable parts of town. After that, I wasn't left with nearly as many options as you'd think.\nThen I found the listing for the San Carlos. I loved that they're one of the very last independently owned hotels in NYC, catered to a European clientele (which usually means non-fussy rooms, immaculately clean spaces, and competent staff), and the Manhattan East location; the area was convenient to RCMH where we were seeing 2 nights of concerts. The fact the rooms looked large vs the price and came w/ mini fridges and microwaves (somewhat unusual for Manhattan) sealed the deal. But looking good on paper doesn't mean in reality it will pan out.\nI'd made my reservation months in advance, over the phone, for a certain room type that the young lady I spoke to had 100% guaranteed. When I called week-of to confirm my reservation, I was told there was a possibility I might not be able to get the room type I'd been promised. Irked, I referenced the original reservation but they explained sometimes these things happen. True, but I hung up the phone and considered rebooking elsewhere; the phone rang back moments later and the young lady I originally spoke to apologized, said they would upgrade me at no fee and get me what I needed no matter what, and really acted as if she valued my business. I'd expect this from a 5 star property, but at a under $300 a night spot, it was refreshing. Customer service is a dying art. The staff at the San Carlos is old school, in the best possible, most refreshing way.\u00a0\nUpon arrival, an easy cab ride from Penn Station, the lobby was sparkling, the bellman exceptional, and the check-in flawless. It's not the fanciest place, more suited for the upscale business traveler (though I spied many families too) but the cleanliness, a huge factor for me, absolutely perfect. And my room, a King, was HUGE. Not huge just by NYC standards, huge by any hotel standard.\u00a0\nThe view from our particular room wasn't much to see, but windows that actually open in both the room and bathroom were a bonus. The amenities were lovely, towels and robe divinely soft, the bed linens super comfy, and a pant press a blast from the past. The room was modern, simple, understated, private, quiet, and cozy. Everything worked too. Which should go without saying but unfortunately is often not the case in any class of hotel. The real silverware, plates, and glasses provided were a great compliment to the microwave and fridge.\n\u00a0Did I mention that housekeeping is outstanding? In my years of travel, I've never seen more competent housecleaning.\u00a0\nMy interaction with the staff was easy peasy. Items I needed were sent up immediately, dinner spots/phone numbers provided, and I was always greeted with a smile. I dreaded check out because it meant our experience was over. I literally had zero complaints during my entire stay except that the Indian restaurant next door (that serves as the San Carlos' complimentary breakfast serving area and then offers their own menu for limited room service too), is simply not up to par with the rest of the hotel. \u00a0If 24 hour American cuisine room service is a make it or break it deal for you, that's about the only reason I'd consider finding a different hotel. Seeing as Manhattan has every food conceivable, most of it deliverable, I easily overlook this.\nQuiet rooms, pleasant interiors/halls, a great business center/overflow lobby, elevators that were kept constantly cleaned (check the Ritz for smudges, lol), and staff that valued my business means that next I'm in NYC I'm making a beeline right back here. Sure, there's more glamorous or hip spots, but for the level of service vs price and comfort, there's a reason this is a hidden gem amongst your hundreds of NYC hotels.

The few times I decided to walk to the downtown, a 15-minutes walk took me to the heart of it.

Our only problem was the horrible room service experience on the day of our departure. They messed up our order not just once, but twice and it was still not correct! We had ordered two steaks-medium rare with broccoli and a toffee cake dessert with ice cream. The 1st time they forgot the broccoli, cooked our steakes well, and brought us up a plate of toffee cake with the ice cream completely melted! Shame to even try serving a guest a dessert that looked like that! The server apologized and said the kitchen was too hot, but that is no excuse! The second time it took over an hour to get our meal. This time they seperated the ice cream and cake which was great, remembered the broccoli, but our steaks were still well! By then we were so hungry and had no time (or nerve) to request a re-make. The kitchen took care of our meal but we were still highly dissatisfied. We complained to the front office manager, Mrs. Heinrichs, who was very nice and did say they were short staffed (one person was shuttling and delivering room service simultaneously?) but they should have gotten another attendant or someone from the restaurant to help.

This hotel is perfect if you are are going on holidays to Manhattan with a family.\nWe were on a family trip of a lifetime to New York for a few days and this hotel made it the perfect holiday.

The kitchen had a normal (by Irish standards) sized fridge and cooker plus a microwave. It was just an alcove really but perfectly adequate for preparing / heating up the goodies from Fairways.\nThere was a laundry across the hall from us which also had two payphones - so we could use prepaid phone cards to call home very cheaply. Tea and coffee were provided. The coffee perculator was intuitive to use and made exceptionally nice coffee.\nFairways supermarket is directly across the road. It is not for the faint hearted as it is a warren, and very busy. At the meat and deli counters you need to take a ticket and wait for your number to be roared out (took me a while to figure this out!)That said, it is a tourist attraction in its own right for those more used to pushing a trolly around Tescos or Lidl. Just don't take kids when you are doing that first supplies shop especially if they are just off the plane and tired. We remained pretty much on Irish time while in New York as it was only for a few days so meals from Fairways at the dining table in our room was ideal rather than restaurants with children.\nThe subway is left out of the hotel and two minute walk. There is a self service machine on the way in. We put $20 on a metrocard which allowed the four of us to be swiped through one after the other. You can see your balance at the turnstyle as you swipe. Just be sure you know your uptown from your downtown before you travel. The subway stops at convenient points for all tourist attractions.\nCentral Park is two blocks away and a haven to come back to in the afternoon after sighseeing.

And speaking of warmth, I had to call my \"personal assistant\" for several blankets because my room was so very cold. With the temperature set way above \n70, I could not get the room over 68. Why would a hotel of this caliber not have a true concierge staff headed up by a member of the clefs d'or? I called prior to arrival to ask about theatre tickets and the personal assistant had no idea what show (on Broadway) that I was speaking about. First thing she asked me was had I gone online to Telecharge to look for tickets. Huh? During my first day at the hotel I again called my assistant for dinner reservations within the hotel. This time I was told to call the restaurant directly. I guess I am unclear as to what the staff is there for. They are nice young people, but woefully undertrained. First evening I asked the doorman for a taxi. He never greeted me or made eye contact. He seemed preoccupied with the headsets that he was wearing and asked me several times where I was going. \nOn the plus side, front desk staff was very pleasant and room service and housekeeping could not have been nicer.

In the event I very nearly cancelled due to the awful effect of Hurricane Sandy and the uncertainty of what we would find, but the hotel gave me assurances by telephone that they were almost functioning at 100%. We were so pleased that we went ahead. The staff in the hotel were very pleasant and friendly -- and genuine, not 'have a nice day' whoever you are style. We had some very interesting chats and they had some stories to tell of the impact of the storm on themselves and friends --- but all were very positive and there was also a nice friendly atmosphere among guests who included forlorn marathon runners and some refugees and their dogs. The hotel is tremendously relaxed. We were in an incredible 20th floor room overlooking both 6th Avenue and 29th Street. Just lovely and comfortable. The bed was one of the best ever. It was certainly more spacious than other hotel rooms in big cities that we've been in. We became regulars at the evening Wine Reception and studiously managed three glasses each and also availed of the tea/coffee at reception each morning; though we did miss not having tea or coffee in the room which is after all the norm in UK hotels. Not wanting to deviate from our affection for this hotel, we do want to mention a few other aspects that may be worth consideration by the management: having to pay premium prices for drinking water in the bedroom seemed just a little mean; we didn't really enjoy the breakfast - eggs were quite runny with a strange tang and the sitting area was cold; the hairdryer had a very short cable and there was nowhere in the room really suitable to use it with a mirror; while there were dressing gowns, there were no slippers -- thick socks which served as slippers were hanging in the cupboard and could be purchased, but it's just that any hotel we have been in with robes have also had basic slippers. Oh and by the way we had a brilliant time in New York - we adored the New Yorkers who are for sure among the friendliest, warmest and most genuine people in the world.

We were very happy to have chosen this hotel! It has an elegance not expected for a hotel in NYC for this price! It was super duper trendy, and the rooms have amazing bathrooms, and lots of space and great views!!! (Our view in particular was that of the Empire State Building!).

The bar area, and restaurant are situated on the backside of the hotel, and through the back part of the bar restaurant, you look out through a glass wall of windows onto their xtra big screen hanging on the side of another building across the street! Super cool! The wine hour with appetizers daily is something you will not find in NYC period! The staff was always willing to help with recommendations, even though we are the type of people that research in the weeks prior to our trip where to go and what to do, have no fear, being a fly by the seat of your pants type of guest is perfect in this hotel! They make recs fitting to your interest, and make reservations for you, etc. They take care of it all! Since we celebrated our anniversary there in Oct during our stay, they had a bottle of wine and a fruit tray sent to our room the day we checked in! Sweet! Some have mentioned that they don't like this part of town...because it is just shy south of the hub-bub of times square, but I found that great!!

The people make the place, thus the title of my review.\nI have spent over 60 nights this year at this hotel and consider it the very best hotel I have every been at. I say this from several perspectives (starting with the staff, above). The ground floor is stunning. The massive open area is very impressive and compares well with all but the most exclusive 5-star hotels. It is truly world class. \nThis is a convention hotel and when it is busy there are people milling about everywhere. This can be a form of entertainment in itself. There are places one can go to escape all the noise and commotion when one needs some quiet time so don't feel intimidated by this aspect.\nThe breakfast is amazing. The food is gourmet quality. The fruits are freshiest and tastiest I've had. Even something as simple as scrambled eggs is a real treat. Don't miss it. It is well worth the price.\nThe location is great. It is next to convention, baseball, and basketball/concert venues. One can walk to most downtown places, but a cab is immediately available at the whistle of the bell captain. The LRT is within an easy walk, and it goes all the way to Reliant Stadium.\nThis hotel is not cheap, but you get what you pay for (world class) - the best staff in the business, gourmet food, some great rooms with great views, tranportation on demand, and a home away from home.", "author": {"username": "Gary S", "num_reviews": 1, "id": "9B34E14B6B3E193835D7F0DDE6D06CE0", "location": "Industry, Pennsylvania", "num_helpful_votes": 1}, "date_stayed": "October 2012", "offering_id": 282699, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "October 20, 2012", "id": 143298050, "via_mobile": false}

I was sick and I called the front desk SEVERAL times to tell them not to cancel my reservation which was GUARANTEED with a CC because I would be there by 6 a.m. Monday morning instead of Sunday night. The reservation WAS cancelled and the hotel was booked for the entire length of my conference - no apologies at the time. I wrote a letter and finally got a \"free romance weekend night\" apology. That night was last Friday 8.1.08. First of all, we were given the \"murder central\" room at the end of the hall by the stairwell where the noise transfers extensively. The only time I have been given this room in the past is when I get a \"priceline room\" or the \"military rate\" room. Our romantic strawberries were great. And then, it started - the noise. About 9 p.m. we could hear very loud laughter. We waited to see if it would quit on it's own - I AM NOT A COMPLAINER! really. We complained about the noise twice before 11 p.m. - no apologies or offer to move us to a quieter room. I was awake listening to DOORS SLAM! loud laughter, someone singing in the shower near me, and music. I finally called the front desk around 4 a.m. They said there was nothing they could do and offered to move us. WE LEFT - sleeping in my bed at home with my three dogs and cat was is more romantic! The entire hotel management and especially the front desk manager Michele K. does not have a good handle on the staff or the quality of service. The rooms ARE dated - looks like something Lucy and Dezi would have stayed in on one of their trips to California... Room Service is limited.

Flashed the room key and in we went. \nAll went well during our four night stay until our departure, on checking the bill it had been charged to the wrong card I was assured it would be changed, got back to the UK to find the bill had been charged to my card in error, which has just been refunded to my card after eleven days, after many phone calls and emails to the hotel and visa, I am still awaiting a part refund for the difference in the exchange rates that the banks had the nerve to charge me,which amounts to a couple of hundred dollars, if the total had been a couple of hundred dollars I would not have pursued it as much but as it was $4000 it needed dealing with asap, an awful lot of work for something which should never have happened as I felt I had dealt with this before my departure on the 24th sept, everyone was very apologetic about the issue but I really could have done without all this hassle, Thanks for the stay Setai it was great except for the issue and work on my return home.\nPS.

Listing the positives first, the hotel is admittedly a beautifully decorated well thought out property and the head butler Brandon was fantastic. Unfortunately, I left the hotel utterly disappointed and completely enraged by the front desk staff and management.\nWhen booking a junior suite two months out, I requested one with a terrace and asked for an early check-in depending on availability. Two weeks out I called to reconfirm the request and when the hotel called me two days out I repeated it for a third time. During check-in, my request was once again relayed, though unfortunately a terrace suite wasn't available that day nor could I check in early... no big deal. However, I was told I could move rooms the following day to have the terrace to which I agreed to.\nLater that day when our room was ready (received no phone call btw even though we were informed we would be called), it was once again communicated we would like to move the next day. The next day when I called in the front desk staff had no idea what I was talking about, but were looking into it. I called back 20 minutes later when we had to leave for a tour and were told they didn't have an answer yet, but the manager would call. Once again, no phone call was received. \nUpon return to the hotel, I was told they were very sorry, but room wasn't available. Of course we had not unpacked due to the promised room transfer and was quite frustrated at the huge lack of communication especially by such an expensive/highly rated hotel. Unfortunately, I did not have time to continue the discussion as we needed to change and head to a show, but informed the manager I expected him to do something to write their wrong of over promising, not communicating between staff members and not ever calling/following up with me. Once again, a phone call was promised and never received.\nThat night upon return was my bubbling point as there was a new and very rude girl working the desk who told me essentially all I was saying was a lie and no request for a room was every made, meaning no phone calls before arriving, no communication upon check in, etc. I proceeded to go off on her and her manager who finally realized they were wrong and apologized. But guess what... nothing was ever done by them.\nBeing in the customer service business you need to control your clients expectations and if they have simply told me the room wasn't available upon check in then no big deal. Instead they caused a huge ordeal as they lacked any resemblance of customer service or professionalism. I would never ever recommend this hotel and the frustration/stress their front desk caused essentially ruined me and my girlfriend's trip to NYC.", "author": {"username": "NBMatthew", "num_cities": 5, "num_helpful_votes": 9, "num_reviews": 10, "location": "Newport Beach, California", "id": "350BD4E529DC955C8C319D13E7507013"}, "date_stayed": "September 2012", "offering_id": 1641016, "num_helpful_votes": 6, "date": "September 10, 2012", "id": 139938229, "via_mobile": false}

We have been to New York a few times and this was by far the best location we have stayed at. An easy taxi or walk to all locations and perfect for getting about.\nWe stayed in a King Deluxe City View which was great. We were meant to upgrade to a Suite but the room was so nice that we decided to avoid the hassle and requested to remain in the room. This is where my minor issue occurred. On check out the bill for the 2 night adjustment was huge...we also hadn't been told it would be assuming (probably wrongly) that the rate would remain the same as we had been paying. On the day the manager did try to help and reduce things a bit but I subsequently contacted them on my return and they were able to reduce things fully for us. It was wrong not to say the rate would change when we said we would stay but the way it was handled was superb and I would not hesitate to stay again.\nBack to the hotel. The room was spacious and clean. The views were great and the service in the room (both room service and cleaning) was good. The lifts were a bit slow but we were there at the same time as a large French party who all seemed to leave at the same time. Certainly nothing to moan about as it was all good fun cramming into the lift!\nWhat I do want to highlight above anything else is the fantastic and personalised service provided by one member of the front of house, Kevin Rountree. The trip to NY was planned so that I could propose to my girlfriend. Living in Hong Kong the logistics of doing this were tricky so I contacted the front desk a few weeks before to see if someone could help. That someone was Kevin who helped arrange EVERYTHING and most of it in his free time. He was even at the proposal location (a bookshop recommended by him) to set everything up on his morning off. Honestly cannot think of anywhere that has given such a personalised service and whilst we may have got lucky with Kevin specifically we could sense that the overall vibe was that people were there to help. Kevin though we have to thank you again and hope someone gives you a promotion for your efforts!\nWe would stay and perhaps even plan to do so again in 2013.

Seriously - it was like he was in the room with us. We determined that the vent was to blame. We mentioned it to the front desk, their response: \"We're very sorry\"\n6. Cold water.

When I also manage to get the same exceptional service and attention as those who can easily afford such luxury, it's a very rare combination indeed. But the Sherry hit a home run on both counts and I think that I've found my special go-to place to stay. From the youngest to the oldest employee, from the early morning/late night front desk staff to every single elevator captain and bellop, ALL were unfailingly polite and cheerful! You really get the sense that they love their jobs and they are super happy to serve. Each time my mother and I came through the door, I felt as though we were truly welcomed \"home\". In fact, it got to be nothing to just hang out in the lobby and get the best tips on where to shop or get the best coffee and brunch. I am serious...this staff can give the top hotels in NYC some lessons in true hospitality.\nRoom 211, which I think was a wonderful upgrade on their part, is fit for any special occasion. Spacious, beautifully appointed with a big screen TV and a gazillion cable stations, a wonderful large bathroom, lots of light , and a birds-eye view of the CBS Early Show studio....not to mention a corner of the famous corner anchored by The Plaza Hotel. There were times when we just felt like \"staying put\", but we didn't miss out on the buzz of the city. It was right outside to see!\nWant to get away quick? The subway stop is right around the corner of the hotel. You can be in Union Square (HUGE Filene's and Whole Foods Market) in less than 25-minutes. Feel like you need to commit to an East Side -vs-West Side experience? Don't bother. You can do both without much effort with cabs and cross-town buses all around -- not to mention horse drawn carriages. An escape to the more magical? Famous Central Park, which can seem postively other-worldly in the quiet morning sunlight, is steps aways.\nWhen in NYC, we usually stay at The Casablanca, The Elysee, and The Lucerne. Each has a lot to recommend it. But I honestly have to say that I am going to take time to check out the Sherry first before I look elsewhere from now on.

The first two days, no one bothered me when the Do Not Disturb sign was up, and when I left the room around 11am on those days, I called Housekeeping and told them my room was available to clean. The third day, at around 10:30am, Housekeeping CALLED ME, saying the Do Not Disturb sign was up, did I want any towels? I would expect that in a cheap motel, but the prices here do not reflect a cheap motel. When I complained, instead of apologizing, the staff made excuses. There is no excuse for calling a room when the Do Not Disturb sign is up. There are nicer hotels for this price.

Let me tell you that a few days was just not enough. I wish I could have stayed longer! \nPeter, the doorman, greeted us and right away I knew there was something special about this NYC hotel: THE PERSONAL TOUCH that is just lacking in some bigger hotels. Yes, the Chatwal is a smaller hotel, but the secret to its success is that it has a BIG heart. This is very evident in their staff. I have traveled all over and have never received such service from a wonderfully friendly, well-trained, professional staff. Brandon, head butler, came to our room to check on us personally and to see that we had everything we needed. Tall, stately, and with classic white gloves, he certainly represented the hotel well.\nI talked mostly to two people at the front desk, Lance and Elizabeth, who were polished, knowledgeable, and again, very friendly. When I called for assistance, I think I always talked to them, too.\nAs to location, The Chatwal has a prime location, just a few blocks away from Times Square, and we were able to walk nearly everywhere we wished to go.\nI took full advantage of our fabulous concierge, Nick, who was even able to get us tickets to \u201cPhantom,\u201d with very short notice. He also booked our tea time at the Palm Court and gave us some very good advice as to where to shop and sight see. He handed us directions that we could take with us, which we greatly appreciated.\nOur suite was what I would call \u201cmodern classic,\u201d and I would define that as, extremely comfortable, but very high tech. I don\u2019t think I ever did figure out all the buttons on the toilet and the heated seat would actually spoil you. The TV in the bathroom is an interesting touch. The shower\u2026okay, I\u2019d like to live in the shower. It had a huge rain shower head and it the entire bathroom was done in black marble with silver chips that made you think of the moon against a dark sky. We also appreciated the Internet connection and wireless service.\nWhen you stay at the Chatwal, don\u2019t forget to book something in the spa, which is on the lower level. I had a pedicure and Lupe was just a joy to chat with\u2026and she did a great job on my feet and toes!\nWe had a delicious breakfast one morning. Do NOT pass up the pastries. You can go back on your diet when you get home! The almond croissants and pain au chocolat were better than some I have gotten in fabled French restaurants. We had dinner one night there and I just had to ask who the chef was, since it was such a delightful meal. I was told that the chef is Jeffrey Zacharian and you may have seen him on Iron Chef, as a winner. I was also told that he is going to do a show for the Food Channel in the future. That should be interesting.\nOur savior was the Chatwal\u2019s Assistant Manager, George Petkovic. I think this man can be everywhere at once! His energy is boundless. He called us the morning we were scheduled to leave the hotel to inform us that our flight reservations had been cancelled for that evening. The airline had not given him a reason for the cancellation, but within 15 minutes he had gotten us alternative reservations. Since we had to leave a bit earlier than we planned, George had also booked a car for us. After doing all that, he came to our suite to check on us and offer his assistance, but we were all packed. The next thing I knew, we were safely in the car, heading for the airport. What amazing service!\nAs I said at the beginning, I wish I could have stayed longer and whenever I am in NYC, you may find me at the Chatwal Hotel.", "author": {"username": "Queenjo", "num_reviews": 4, "id": "0C65643A9DE3473BBB7C0625DB71B6AF", "location": ""}, "date_stayed": "August 2012", "offering_id": 1641016, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "September 3, 2012", "id": 139279635, "via_mobile": false}

The rooms are decorated in a modern clean style but the fittings are not of a high quality and already have a lot of damage. The carpets were a neutral cream colour and were stained badly. The location, versus the price, versus the experience dont add up! The gym is a room with no windows and no atmosphere. Its dark and not inspiring to train. This is a shame as there is some good equipment. I trained in there once and then went to another local gym.

The hotel is very nice and modern. There are lots of little touches that set it apart, like providing free beverages when you arrive, free beverages and snacks in your room, and a free wine happy hour in the evenings. The restaurant was very good, with very good service. The location is also very central near the library and Bryant Park. \nOur check in was great. We arrived about noon and our room was not ready. We were given coffee and sparkling water while bags were checked in. Kelly took great care of us. Later Amy brought us to our room and also took great care of us. The room was larger, modern with a lounge couch, with a slight view of the Library down the street, but near the elevators. It seemed like a nice modern styled room, which we like. Then night time came. I could hear a high pitched noise from behind the walls that had been covered up by New York traffic during the day. And the noise was even worse deeper in the room and bathroom, away from the windows. I took my Ambient sleeping pill to try and block it out, but only got about four hours sleep and woke up to a splitting headache from the noise. Since we were staying three nights, I asked my husband to talk to the front desk about moving us to a new room. He was told the hotel was full and that they would send up an 'engineer' to look at the problem. Unless they were going to break through walls, I knew the problem could not be fixed by a handyman they would send up. I checked on Hyatt's website and found out they had lied to my husband because the hotel was not full. Next we both went down to the front desk to confront the man (sorry don't know his name) about the dishonesty and to let him know this problem was beyond a handyman repair problem. As I was trying to express my thoughts about the situation he kept saying 'I hear what you are saying, I hear what you are saying' which could not be true because he kept interrupting me and cutting me off from trying to tell him what I was saying. Finally he left and Kelly, the great and very professional lady who checked us in, came and took care of everything. She didn't question our need to move, tell us it was an engineering problem, lie about the hotel being full, or argue with us in any way. She just very gracefully took care of the problem. While we went out and enjoyed the day, she had our bags moved to another room (no high pitched noise, away from the elevators) and she also had a complementary bottle of champagne sent up. Kelly took a very bad situation that would have had us checking out of the hotel that day, and turned the rest of our stay into a wonderful experience. Instead of us being upset about the bad room and poor treatment, we instead had a very nice stay thanks to her. She is a real asset to the hotel, very professional and personable.\nRegarding the staff and the wine happy hour, it is also spotty. Our first night, (Thursday Sept 27th), a lady was working the happy hour area. She saw us come in but she was having a conversation with a customer (about the California coast) so we sat there for over 10 minutes without any acknowledgement we were there. Finally my husband went into the lobby to ask for assistance and Amy, the nice and professional lady who took us to our room, came in and served us wine. The the lady who left us waiting for service gave us dirty looks after this, like we had done something wrong. The next night however, we went to the wine happy hour and received excellent service from a very friendly man. He was three times busier than the lady from the night before but was giving everyone great friendly service. \nOur waiter in the restaurant was also very good, professional, friendly and efficient. It was nice having a very good restaurant in the hotel, especially after exhausting days in New York.\nThis is a very good hotel with good amenities, some great service and some poor service.

Be sure and check out the Tavern's Keep cocktail bar on the first floor - they serve 1800-1920s era classic cocktails, with top notch ingredients and great presentation.\nThe front desk staff was good enough, but Vanessa, the Chief Concierge was fabulous. She took care of all of the tasks I needed done in advance - arranging car service for us from Newark, getting a reservation at one of the finest restaurants in NYC for our anniversary, printing out Empire State Building tickets, etc. She even took care of a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates for our anniversary - very nice.\nThe combination of location of the hotel, cleanliness and ammenities, and professionalism of staff made The Iroquois Hotel the perfect choice.

(44th between 5th and 6th ave).\nAs such it is ideally situated for Grand Central and the Theatre District.\nIf you don't mind the walk, Central Park is not too far and hardcore shoppers will go crazy for the number of high end stores around this area (Macy's is 10 blocks south and 2 avenues over).\nWe however, found that many of the places we wanted to visit, required a short cab ride (Chelsea, West Village, Lincoln Center). Cabs are easy to get and inexpensive - plus you can pay by card at no extra charge these days.\nIf you are looking for a relaxing slice of NY life, this area is to be avoided. If you enjoy hustle and bustle - the centre of the action is right here. Bear this in mind when choosing a room in the hotel - if you are at the front of the building, you need to be high up.\nWe stayed in two different rooms. The first room was a classic room with 2 double beds in the middle of the hotel on the 4th floor - it had views of a burnt out building and (because of the buildings shape) also afforded an excellent view into a neighbouring guests' room.\nThis room had a small thin bathroom and a strange bath/shower arrangement with sliding doors and this made it difficult to get in and out. The decor however, was extremely nice. \nWe extended our stay and moved to a Suite at the front of the hotel on the 8th floor. This consisted of a lounge with two sofas, a desk and two armchairs, a chest of drawers, some tables and a large TV plus mini fridge. Then a bedroom with a US King / UK superking bed, plus an armchair with footstool, a chaise long style bench, a chest of drawers, a couple of tables and another large TV. Also a very thin closet. The bedroom leads onto a beautifully decorated bathroom with a separate show and jacuzzi bath and lots of towels plus robes.\nWe loved the mattress and linens in both of the bedrooms we stayed in. I will be investigating purchasing the mattress for our new house.\nOne major drawback for us, was the low lighting levels in both of these rooms. At some point in the past, the hotel decided to remove the central light fixture from each room, leaving beautiful but somewhat impractical mood lighting as the only light source (lamps, picture spots etc). At times we even turned the TV on to provide more lighting! In our first room, we asked for an extra lamp - which was some help but I believe they use low wattage/energy saving bulbs, so not a complete solution.\nThe service in this hotel was excellent. Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly and resourceful staff. This was particularly helpful when I was taken ill and required special considerations.\nOther small but nice features of this hotel, are the switches on the back of the door, which can be turned red for DO NOT DISTURB or green, so that a member of staff can ring your doorbell for service.\nThe library downstairs is very small but comfortable and there is a good selection of books/papers, plus computers with internet.

We had high expectations given the trusted recommendation and that Joel Freyburg's (the GM) assistant assured my husband that we would be treated like VIPs for our special trip. I have to say that I was very let down. First let me recognize the hotel for all that was great about it. The location is fantastic- close to Time Square but on a quiet street that allows you to escape. The design and furnishings in the hotel were top notch. The hotel had an art deco feel in the lobby and the room was well appointed and the furniture, appliances/technology was first class. There was a TV built into the bathroom vanity which surprisingly I enjoyed. There was a rain shower and also a hand held- very nice shower but more to tell on that in a moment.... And my favorite feature was the toilet. I know it sounds crazy but the seats were heated and the bidet was perfect! And lastly the spa was great and my massage was excellent. \nSo where did it fall short you ask? The service (with the exception of the bell and door men who were great). All presented a friendly aim to please spirit and the white gloves were a nice touch but the service fell apart in the execution. It started upon my arrival. Our room wasn't ready which was fine so I asked the concierge for a spa recommendation. I did not know they had a spa in the hotel and his response was \"Well what about our spa, is it too expensive?\". Rule number one, never assume anything about someone's finances. I ended up going to the spa in the hotel and that is when the second incident occurred. After my massage I asked if I could go up to my room in the spa robe. The spa agreed and called to the front desk to have my keys brought down to the spa so that I would not have to go to the main lobby. We waited for 25 minutes for my key that never arrived (after 2 additional calls to the front desk) and finally I had to go and get my own key in my robe. The third incident was that I did not know how to make the shower water warm (not the hotel's fault) so on the first night of our stay we called for help and they said they would send someone up. After waiting and hearing nothing I took a cold shower. I called early that next morning and the engineer was not in, so once again I could not get help with the shower until after we were scheduled to leave for our breakfast reservation so I took my second cold shower that am. I am assuming that the engineer did fix the shower because it worked great that evening but after 2 cold showers you would think someone would let us know that it was handled and ensure that we knew how to use the shower appropriately. At this point I was done. \nThe final kicker for me was that when asked if we enjoyed our stay the day of our departure, I politely expressed my dissatisfaction and the lady at the front desk kindly apologized and asked to make it up to us on our next visit. While I believe she was sincere, offering to rectify an issue on some future date that may never occur is a service faux pas. You can not assume you will get a second chance to make something right.

If you can get rooms for $119-$130 a night, it is extremely worth it. Hopefully they don't raise them too high, but this hotel could probably easily be priced much higher, but then again they are the experts so they know what they're doing. They attracted me, didn't they? \nWe stayed a Friday and Saturday night, three day weekend in Houston. The only major downside would have to be that it's on the Katy Freeway, so coming in on Friday from the east can be a pain, unless you take the beltway around. Exit I-10 East from the Beltway all the way on the west side of town and you get your own dedicated exit to Gessner and the hotel. Made things much easier than coming across straight on I-10. \nValet parking isn't cheap. You can park yourself for cheaper. But the valet staff was really helpful and professional. You won't be disappointed using them. \nChecking in was about as painless as I've ever experienced, plus they registered me into their rewards program too, didn't take long at all. The elevators are key access above the third floor for added security. Most modern hotels have this. \nThe room was only a traditional yet it was much larger than I was imagining. On the 7th floor. It had an excellent view, large floor to ceiling windows. It had a good size refrigerator. The bathroom shower had two shower heads. The tub didn't drain very quickly, but it wasn't an issue for me. Also, the phone calls to valet were very staticy. Wish wifi or computer access was free. Read that it wasn't, but we didn't use it, so I can't totally say for certain. \nThere is an open patio area on the 18th floor, hot tub, infinity pool that is 3-4 feet, large sitting area and fitness area. It was really nice and the breeze for a late spring day was great. In winter, it could get cold up there. \nI didn't eat in the hotel besides the bar snacks so I can't rate the food. The bar, 024, was superb. Great service and drinks for reasonable prices to other major bars in major cities. \nThe location is really great. It's off Gessner at Memorial City Mall. There is a skybridge to the mall. They have Target, Macy's, Apple Store, sports stores, etc. For food, they have a food court, plus a sports bar, California Pizza Kitchen, Cheesecake Factory and a Tex Mex place although it was more like line up service, not a traditional restaurant. \nNoise wasn't an issue in the room. I heard an ambulance once for the nearby hospital. Storms came through and although I could see the lightning, I never heard the thunder. The beds are very comfortable, a ton of pillows, too many for me. And the bedspread kind of got me hot but I just kicked it off. The bed itself was very comfortable. Huge flat panel tv also with a lot of channels. \nOn the weekend, the drive on the Katy wasn't a problem at all into the city. You won't regret staying here, especially for the price. I'd say anything under $180-200 is good, under $130-140 is great at this place.", "author": {"username": "DW W", "num_cities": 14, "num_helpful_votes": 27, "num_reviews": 40, "num_type_reviews": 12, "id": "9376279643376CF0F1673C1089AB6371", "location": "Baton Rouge, LA"}, "date_stayed": "May 2012", "offering_id": 1966350, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "May 17, 2012", "id": 130135518, "via_mobile": false}

They state that they will give you the \"best room available\" However, at Andaz they gave me most likely one of the worst. It was very small, with a view on an ugly inner court and worn-out furniture.\nOn top of it, most of the waiters at the restaurant on the ground floor are rude and unhelpful. Even though they can easily charge up to $200 per person for dinner, the quality of service is not there.

When I gave them a call, they told me that it was for breakfast on our last day. And they were genuinely surprised when I told them that breakfast is always complimentary for diamond members.

I got in at supper time and had to call for delivery from a pizza place nearby that had a pretty limited menu.\nThe indoor pool is quite small and is located right next to a sitting area in the lobby so unless you want to be on display while you swim, it's not really useful.\nIf I go back to Houston, I'll probably opt for a hotel in the downtown core, and one that has an in-house restaurant.", "author": {"username": "kstevens", "num_cities": 2, "num_helpful_votes": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "location": "St. John's", "id": "93736A77376583CC17DD02D96FF9EB37"}, "date_stayed": "March 2008", "offering_id": 239853, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "March 21, 2008", "id": 14433843, "via_mobile": false}

From the moment I stepped into the hotel, greeted by Debbie Bunn, it was a wonderful experience! ALL the family and friends stayed at the hotel. The Rehearsal Dinner and Cocktail Hour before were perfection! YIPPPEEEE! A business that KNOWS their business and does it to....yep! Perfection!!!! More to say about the Hilton Garden Inn......I delivered 22 baskets to the hotel on Wednesday before the wedding. Family and friends began arriving on Thursday and would arrive all the way through to Saturday afternoon. Each and every person received their basket at check-in AND received the correct basket. (Each basket was made for each family in mind.) We're off to a great start! Then, following my dad's birthday celebration at Texas Land and Cattle (already heard that story, did ya?).....we all went back to the hotel and we took over the bar area, stayed around past the time the bar was to close and the bartender told us...no problem! No Problem....I'm sorry, I am just not used to that selfless, customer service oriented behavior....AMAZING!!!!! \nFriday....family and friends still arriving...hotel handling everything smoothly. Shuttle took family and friends to the mall and picked them up again....and was prompt! I arrived at 3:00 to begin decorating the hall. Jennifer is the event planner for the hotel. Another \"Can Do\" person. How could there possibly be that many GOOD people in one place? The room was set up, Marco was there to run everywhere around the hotel for me, finding everything that I requested....HE should be the CEO of Hilton! That guy is over the top! The room was super fun with all the Texas decorations, and the details were all taken care of by Jennifer, Marco and the hotel staff. The cocktail hour was a hit and the appetizers were excellent! They even set up our own little bar! The Barbeque and all the fixins' were superb! People were still talking about it on Saturday! We finally \"let\" Marco and the waitstaff go home about 10:30. They never complained! Just said it was a wonderful event! THE ENTIRE NIGHT AMAZING!!!! THEY WERE AMAZING!!! Once again, we all stayed at the hotel bar area and the lounge area for a while longer. Did the bartender complain? Nope! Sure didn't! What is this hotel feeding its staff? Happiness, Loyalty, Appreciation? Maybe....just maybe.....what a novel idea! Saturday night....Wedding is over, all is well at the hotel. Everyone is resting, including my hubby and myself. They comped us a room for Friday and Saturday night, so if we wanted to be with family, we could. Really? Giving us something for nothing....noooooo way! WAY!!!!!!! We got up on Sunday morning, met everyone for breakfast. They gave us the back area, so that we could all be together and then we all broke bread together as family. It was a wonderful ending to a wonderful weekend. I truly am almost in tears thinking about and writing about \"our\" wonderful hotel. They joined my family that weekend. They were as happy and excited for us, as we were. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you Hilton. God's blessings upon each and everyone of you, and much, much success always.

I'm the trip planner and I always try to find a different area for us to stay in. This year, it was the Upper West Side. My research showed that the Beacon was the best deal for the dates of our trip. October is a very expensive time to come to New York so when I was able to find a 1 bedroom suite for less than 400.00 a night, I made the reservation.\nThe hotel is in a lovely, residential area of New York. When I win the lottery, that's exactly the area I want to live in! We arrived at the hotel at about 10:00 AM on Friday, Oct.5th after a very long cab ride from LGA. Note to self- don't plan our next trip to NYC to arrive during rush hour. Lucky for us, our room was ready when we checked in. The manager on duty was David. He took such good care of us during our stay. This was our 8th annual girl's trip to NYC and as I mentioned we always stay in a different area. The service at this hotel was the best we've ever experienced.\nThe suite was lovely. Our room was on the 20th floor with a beautiful view of the city. The queen bed was so comfortable and the living area had a pull-out couch and a roll-a-way was sent up for us, which was a nice touch. Loved the fully stocked kitchen. The hotel has been renovated recently and our suite was immaculate. One of my favorite things was having a delicious cup of coffee each morning. There is a Fairway market directly across the street and a wine store next door. Very convenient!\nWe had a wonderful trip to NYC as always. Had tickets for the Kelly and Michael show, Jimmy Fallon, Huckabee, and saw an Off-Broadway show, Cougar the Musical. Walked the entire High Line at night, went to Chelsea Market, shopping at Macy's,and had some great pizza in Soho just to name a few of the highlights.\nPlanning another trip to this great city in January, with my husband this time.

We were greeted immediatelyin the lobby with a warm hello and offer of a beverage. Checkin was smooth and since we were just a few minutes early we had to waitfor just a few minuteswhile the hostess checked with housekeeping to ensure our room was ready. We waited in a comfortable area just off the lobby and discovered a nook with 5 full shelves of hardcover novels to borrow during our stay. We were escorted to our room and the staff took time to walk us through the cool features of our \"space\" including touchpad light switches, shower with 3 options (footbath, rainhead or handheld) and the nicest bath sheet towels to wrap up in. The blackout shades would roll down with a touch of a button and we were lucky enough to have a small kitchenette area that included a fridge, freezer,microwave and mini coffee maker that made a nice cup of espresso. This area was stcked with soda and other drinks, I enjoyed the large bottle of organic green tea and my teen loved the fizzy organic soda, the Cocacola was just not as cool! In addition there were kettle cooked potato chips, a dark chocolate bar and one of the most delicious granola bars I've ever had. I saved the package so I can research them on line and order from this local N Y manufacturer. The best part is these snacks are that they are free and replenished each day. In addition,if you visit the lobby there is always coffee, tea, fruit and even wine at a nightly 6pm reception. Prior to our stay the hotel sent an email reminding me of our upcoming stay and asked if there was anything they ould do to make our tay more comfortable. I did respond and let them know we were there to celebrate my daughters birthday- on Friday there was a knock on our door and compliments of the hotel a beautiful piece of chocolate cake arrived with a personalized birthday card wishing her a happy day. All these touches made us feel welcomed and at home during our stay. After a hectic day of touring and running around we splurged on room service at 11pm (the hot dog from a street vendor at 5 was just NOT dinner, but shopping was her 16 yr old focus). The room service staff was courteous, eager to please and prompt. The Andaz is a great value for the money and I do p,an to return, it would ake a great trip with my husband as the hotel has a great bar (whichi was not able to visit this trip) and a nice location.

You really have to be looking for the hotel to know that it is there and once you are arrive it is not entirely clear as to where you enter. You enter the hotel into a very small lobby. Off to the right of the lobby is a nice seating area that I think the Andaz refers to as the Library. To the right of the lobby are bar height tables and chairs . Eight of us ended up gathering here for complimentary wine during Happy Hour. We checked in around 3pm and our rooms were still not ready. This was a little disappointing since I had requested an early check in but in their defense I was told that they were fully booked the previous evening. \nUnlike traditional Hyatt's where there are clearly defined roles (i.e.. concierge, bellman, reception, etc.) the Andaz seems to employ generalists. The same person that checked me in also stored my bags, brought the luggage to my suite and later served us wine in the lobby. The staff goes out of their way to remember your name and did greet us personally several times throughout our visit. This was very impressive\nThe suite was of decent size by NYC standards and had modern decor. The room had a small fridge, microwave and even a dishwasher that were all concealed behind modern cabinetry. The Andaz provides a small quantity of complimentary snacks and beverages in the room. The living area had a very comfortable couch that folded out into an amazingly comfortable sleeper. The high quality King size mattress and high thread count linens made for a comfortable nights sleep. The bathroom is probably the highlight of the accommodations. The walk in rain shower provided seemingly endless hot water. \nI have read some reviews that suggested that this might not be the most ideal location for families. In general I would agree but did notice that there were a number of travelers accompanied by well mannered children. We had our kids with us and they enjoyed the stay. Outside of the room itself there really isn't anything onsite that children would be drawn to but we were there to tour the city. \nThe restaurant is very small for a hotel of this size. We had to wait about 10 min for a table for breakfast. The food is tasty, locally sourced (in some cases) and very fresh. This property does not have a Regency Club and as such offers Diamond status guests a $75 food credit each day. This sounds like a lot but and is very generous but keep in mind $75 will likely feed 2 at breakfast. \nIf you are looking for a grand lobby or a wide array of activities this is not the place for you.

It is not overly large, but not small either. I would describe it as a good standard but not extraordinary.\nStaff was both great and a bit of a miss. The concierge and the bell boys went above and beyond in helping us and really did a great job. I would recommend talking to them about restaurants, air port transfer, shopping etc. Though the fornt desk staff was more of a miss. They felt clueless in several requests and gave contradictory answers and did not feel that professional or knowledgable.\nDuring our stay both the restaurant and the bar was being refurbished, something we were not notified of beforehand. And the breakfast was instead a box collected at the front desk consisting of yoghurt, a croissant and a banana. It was sufficient, but perhaps not something I would expect from a hotel such as this.\nIn summary, it is perfectly located and provides a good nights sleep. But it did not provide me with that feeling of a place that goes above and beyond, though the bell boys certainly do!", "author": {"username": "erhel", "num_cities": 7, "num_helpful_votes": 9, "num_reviews": 15, "num_type_reviews": 7, "id": "04E9B6780687473E3E746FC650D34461", "location": "Stockholm, Sweden"}, "date_stayed": "August 2012", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "September 18, 2012", "id": 140626688, "via_mobile": false}

We were ushered into a separate check-in area and quickly shown to our spacious and elegant apartment which featured a fully equipped galley kitchen, living room with dining table, bedroom and bathroom. While we would never have splurged to upgrade ourselves, it was a wonderful perk. The hotel is older, perhaps a bit dated (could be considered \"classic\"), but seems to be well kept up. The service was exceptional: we enjoyed complimentary newspapers, coffee and delicious breakfast pastries each morning in the Residence's lobby and appreciated all the advice and help with dinner reservations from the concierge. The valet at the main hotel lobby was extremely accommodating and arranged to have the hotel's car and driver take us to a conference event that was a few miles away. One of the highlights of our stay was the Tuesday evening wine tasting event in the Four Seasons wine bar, Vinoteca. We enjoyed four or five generous pours of excellent Italian wines and when my husband remarked that he particularly liked one of them, the waitress came and poured him a full glass! When we returned home we we looked up the wine he had liked so much and found it to be a bottle that sells for $85! There was also a delicious buffet of Italian cheese and fruits and crackers to accompany the wine. Very, very enjoyable! I walked through the smallish pool area and it would have been inviting if not for the stifling heat (well over a hundred.) The one downside to our stay: it always aggravates me to have to pay extra for internet access and the Four Seasons charges a daily fee for internet.\nThe comfortable accommodations were especially appreciated when we left the hotel to find the downtown area highly depressing: soulless architecture, somewhat desolate and grungy, and full of panhandlers. We were not 20 feet from the hotel when we were approached by a man claiming to have car trouble and looking for a handout. We took the light rail out to the museum area and Rice University just to look around and get the lay of the land but the extreme heat in June did not allow us to explore much. We ended up taking the downtown underground tunnels back toward the hotel to get out of the heat and noted very few open businesses and lots of closed/empty storefronts. Houston's downtown seems to have seen better times.

Furthermore, when we asked for more information on the call bill (they gave us the time, not the duration of the calls), the man at reception got quite annoyed and basically implied that we must be idiots if we can't see that the international calls are what cost so much (yes...! but can you tell us how you got to the cost please? the duration?? the rate???). No matter what we said, he just kept saying that it was all written on the bill (on the bill was actually the time of the calls, written in 24 hour time) and the rate is whatever unknown rate they are charged (probably using gold cables being exchanged through luxembourg) plus 75% and scoffing and waving the bill away. He would have clearly seen this was not the case if he'd chosen to listen to us rather than scoffing at our stupidity and gesturing to talk to the hand. Absolutely get a phone card even if, like us, you have no intention of making calls anyway. Or, just use your foreign mobile, its actually WAY cheaper.

We stayed with our two young children, aged 2 and 3 years old and the location is fantastic. You can easily walk to loads of child-friendly attractions including the children's museum, the natural history museum, central park and even the Met by walking through the park. All the museums and galleries also run children's programming so there's even more to them than just looking at the exhibits.\nThe kitchens were VERY basically supplied so even though they say that you have a full kitchen, you can't really cook much. There are no dishes/pans suitable for the oven so its completely redundant. There are also no dishes suitable for cooking food in the microwave... except maybe 4 small plates, 4 dinner plates and 4 shallow cereal bowls. I suppose you could heat a TV dinner in the packaging it comes in or heat baby food etc, otherwise you're completely limited to what you can produce on the stove with a small frypan, one spatula and one small saucepan.\nThe hotel suggests that you contact the Babysitters Guild direct for babysitting services, which we did and we absolutely loved our sitter whose name was Amy.\nThe doormen are lovely and will receive parcels for you if you shop up a storm and need to have things delivered.\nThere is a very handy coin-operated laundry room on one of the floors which costs $1.75 for each box of detergent, wash or dry load.\nThe rooms are small but furnished nicely.

Finally I did assure myself that they did not have any and I would have to find some myself. I walked to two Duane Reade Drugs stores that had no distilled water and finally had to go to a Walgreens in Times Square. I forgive you for not having it but please tell me where I can purchase some. I did attempt to call the hotel manager, not because I was upset but I thought that he should know the operator trying to protect the manager gave me the voice mail of his number two. Not good! You too should not have a tie.\nA $75 breakfast was included with our reservation. Hard to believe $75, but again it was New York and I think an omelet was $17. On our last day we checked out early so they could get the room ready for the next reservation, even though we had about two hours until check out time and when we needed to leave. When I got home I looked at our credit card statement and found $89 charged to our bill for breakfast. $14 above the allowed $75, first how could that be and second why was this not included.

Trash piles up on side streets and most of the surrounding buildings are active warehouses. Lastly, the bathrooms in the suites feature a barn style door on sliders. This very heavy barn door became derailed and trapped two members of our party in the bathroom for several minutes, while the third member of our party was out of the room. Beauty and practicality must come together.\nThe hotel's pricing is about average for New York.\nI recommend this hotel if this is your desired location.", "author": {"username": "westcon", "num_cities": 13, "num_helpful_votes": 8, "num_reviews": 16, "num_type_reviews": 12, "id": "F183F4E71241F709D4466FF6A828A366", "location": "Chicago, Illinois"}, "date_stayed": "November 2011", "offering_id": 1456560, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "October 25, 2012", "id": 143661003, "via_mobile": false}

The rooms are well designed for the size and had a really comfortable, white duvet bed, large flat screen TV, mini bar, safe, desk and two chairs. The decent sized marble bathroom featured a wide vanity and a large shower with teak seat and Etro toiletries. Floor to ceiling windows even had a look-up-to-the-left view of the Empire State Building. Housekeeping twice a day was great and scheduled around us without issue. \nThe negatives: Our room was not ready, which isn't totally inconceivable at 1:00, but the desk attendant didn't seem the least bit welcoming or concerned about our inconvenience--especially since we arrived during a rain storm. First impressions are the most important and I guess we got off to a bad start. Other staff members were friendlier. The hotel decor is comprised of dark grays, black and browns which gave off a dingy vibe in some areas. Lack of sufficient lighting in the room compounded the problem.

The towels were so worn and thin that I thought their sandpaper-like quality might exfoliate my entire body without ever really drying it. Really, it was like a bad summer camp experience.

As a (somewhat disgruntled ) Starwood Platinum member, I have been giving Kimpton a serious try. Most of their hotels are wonderful. Eventi just does not make the grade. The staff for the most part are very gracious. But something is always just not quite right here. My first visit they had some sort of water pipe break which flooded some guest rooms. They gallantly and apologetically put me on a steeper sofa for the night. OK, stuff happens--I understand. The next trip here they somehow cancelled my room--yes I was late, but I had told them I would be late, but they did get me a room and sent a very nice amenity to the room. I kind of decided this one would be chalked up to my fault: I was late arriving. The third visit started out great. An upgrade to a suite by a wonderfully gracious friendly welcome staff. I get to my floor and there are dirty room service trays everywhere. This is at 4:15 PM. One has to order ice here from room service. 25 minutes later and 3 calls it finally arrives. When I complained there was an excuse about the ice has to come from the resturant. I asked if the NYC garbage collection department was responsible for collecting half day old room service litter in the hallways, and asked for the general manager to call me. Yes- I admit my happiness with the suite upgrade had faded now in the face of inattentive service. \nSo my advice: great location, very friendly staff, nice rooms, but the attention to detail leaves a bit to be desired. My experience here makes me re-think my plan to leave Starwood for Kimpton, but I have to admit other Kimpton properties have been quite wonderful.

Hubby was able to go into the other room and watch TV/recline on the sofa when he woke up at 5AM; I was able to sleep in the bedroom undisturbed. Great to have a fridge to store our bottle of wine. Great to have real wine glasses & corkscrew. Nice to have plates to use for any food we brought back. Nice to have a place to put all of that (countertop, sink, small dining table and two chairs). Bathroom is well appointed (Aveda products), with vanity plenty large for two adults to spread out. Reception staff are charming and helpful. Free breakfast offered each morning off the lobby featuring breads, pastries, cereals, yogurts, cottage cheese w/juice, coffee. Fine if you have kids that need filling with carbs.

Some staff are increadibly helpful while others are not. For example, wanting a cup of coffee around 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon we discovered it was cold. When we told the front desk about it, their reply was that we would have to wait a couple of hours until the new shift came on duty. What?! Room service was also slow on some days. We had to wait until 5:30 pm on a Sunday to get a maid to make up our room.\nOn the upside, the breakfast is very nice at a cost of $10 per person. There are cookies in the lobby in the afternoon.

{"ratings": {"overall": 5.0}, "title": "\u201cGreat tourist-class choice -- modern, clean, convenient\u201d", "text": "I was visiting Houston for the first time, and wanted a place that was convenient to downtown (ie, not out by Galleria or the Astrodome), affordable (less than $100 per night, and no hidden fees like parking for the downtown luxury hotels), private (ie not a bed a breakfast). Oddly, didn't find that many options in Houston (seems like all the motels and cheaper hotels are way out in the suburbs). Came upon this Best Western Downtown and got a room (one king bed) for $69 p/n (plus tax), for five nights. Couldn't have been happier with my choice. Room was very large, modern, clean, and in addition to the usual (big tv, coffee maker), had some things I didn't expect (small refrigerator, small dining table with a few chairs around it, free high-speed Internet). No closet -- just an alcove with a clothes rack -- but that didn't bother me. Room and entire hotel were spotless; they said they had been open several years, but if they told me only several months I would have believed them - it was clean and freshly painted, and furniture all seemed new. Other amenities were: free parking, free cont'l breakfast (I didn't use, so can't vouch for quality), pool, and exercise room (small -- just had a few new cardio machines). Service was friendly and helpful, both for maid and front desk. Hotel was pretty empty, but I'm guessing that's because Houston just doesn't attract that many tourists over the Christmas holidays.\nLocation was fantastic - right between downtown (a few blocks to the east) and Melrose (a five minute drive to the west) and River Oaks (about a ten minute drive west) and the Galleria (maybe 15-20 minutes to the west). It's not like there are cafes and shops right outside the front door; but if you get in your car, all the attractions of core Houston (downtown, minute maid field, convention center, melrose, museum district, uptown/galleria, houston heights) are a very short drive. Seemed like a perfectly safe neighborhood -- looked like there had been a lot of construction (townhouses, etc) built in the last 10 years. \nIn sum, if you're looking for an affordable option that is convenient for touring Houston sites (or for business within Loop 610), and don't want to stay in a bed-and-breakfast, I think this is probably one of the best options in Houston (I drove around Houston for five days and didn't see any other comparable-class hotel in the vicinity -- only luxury hotels in downtown and in the Galleria area). This Best Western doesn't offer up a ton of charm -- no big surprise for a tourist-class chain hotel/motel -- but for under $100 a night, it met and exceeded my expectations", "author": {"username": "", "id": "", "location": ""}, "offering_id": 239853, "num_helpful_votes": 8, "date": "January 18, 2005", "id": 3013808, "via_mobile": false}

Check in girl offered an upgrade to a King suite for a $50 or so up charge. I declined (thinking I had a regular King room). Got to my room and found two TWIN beds. Went downstairs and asked for a different room from different clerk no more than 30 minutes later. He said the hotel was sold out and did not have anything (even though previous clerk had offered a different room for an upcharge). Didn't have time to argue because I was late for dinner so decided to come back later and deal with it then. Came back a few hours later and asked the same guy and he said yes there was a room for the $50 up charge. I was tempted to argue for a complimentary upgrade, but was too tired at this point and just paid it. When I did get to the room it was a King Suite, but nothing too amazing. Very disappointed in how dark the bathroom was though. The only saving grace was the bed was quite comfortable, but other than that I've received better rooms and service from Westins and Marriotts.

It includes juice, milk, coffee, danishes, muffins, breads, etc. Nothing hot other than coffee. It has a small gym which I used twice. It has 2 treadmills, an elliptical machine, stationary bike, and free weights. Perfect for a decent workout. I ran to and through Central Park. The hotel in centrally located. 2 blocks from a subway station with an elevator which is an issue for us since we travel with a wheelchair. 4 blocks east of Rockerfeller Center and about 8 blocks from Times Square. Blocks in NYC are short so most things are within walking distance if you're a walker, and you can always find a subway near by if you're not. \nThe night staff was wonderful in making restaurant recommendations. The gentlemen made suggestions and each one was better than the next. Chin Chin was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants I've eaten at. The staff was welcoming, courteous and helpful.

The staff is definitely one of the best I know: very professional but quite relaxed too, which I like. It's a good change from the arrogance you get at SLS and some Ws and the overwhelming assistance of some other luxury places.

But, hardly worth the $200 a night I paid on a recent one night trip over to the Houston area for a football game. I had high hopes to stay at the visiting team hotel to truly make it a fan experience. I called numerous hotels who told me to check with the Hilton Americas. I eventually spoke with the hotel manager who explained they are a \"preferred NFL team hotel\". While I understand they can not tell me who is staying at the hotel, they can certainly tell me who isn't, and they had no problem mentioning that the \"Home team\" was staying and The Rolling Stones stayed just a week prior. Unfortunately, my team was not staying at this hotel and I was suckered into thinking they were.\nThe staff was not very knowledgeable about the surrounding area. My wife and I were looking for lunch and led on a wild goose chase trying to find a simple quick meal. There really is not any places to eat (outside of paying hotel prices) with-in about 3-4 blocks. \nAlso, for the football game, we were told the metro rail would be the best way to take the cheapest trip to the stadium. The concierge failed to mentioned to us, it is a free ride to and from on game days. Something a random stranger had to tell us after we paid for tickets to and from.\nWhile I found the bed comfortable, the pillow left little to be desired. I simply could not get comfortable as it was like sleeping with my head on a rock. Also, note that the thermostat does not have a \"fan on\" setting. So, its hard to drown out noise from the hallway. I was startled awake numerous times with people coming and going in the hallway.\nAlso worth noting, the ice machine on our floor was broken. Not all that big of a deal, but when you pay over $200 for a nights stay you expect things like that to work.\nI can honestly say, I feel ripped off. From the attempted fan experience to the broken ice maker. I wish I would have saved myself $150 bucks and stayed somewhere with a free breakfast and free parking.", "author": {"username": "neilwilsonvoice", "num_cities": 4, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "num_reviews": 7, "num_type_reviews": 5, "id": "FFA1A1BCAE11BC56129A22F4B55717E6", "location": "Prairieville, Louisiana"}, "date_stayed": "August 2012", "offering_id": 282699, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "August 20, 2012", "id": 137761722, "via_mobile": false}

The parking lot gate was up when we arrived, and when I inquired I was told that it was put down later in the night, but I wasn't awake to confirm this and it was open by the time we departed. This policy left me feeling a bit misled and nervous about the gated parking. Fortunately, there were no problems. The fitness room provided a nice workout, although it was a bit warm due to poor AC.

In summary, great facility, great location, but this hotel has some serious service issues. Please excuse the spelling mistakes - the email was sent from a smart phone.\n---\nMr <name removed>,\nGood morning -\nWe just left the chatwal this morning and wanted to share with you the experience we had with your hotel. I am a starwood platinum member and do in average 30 to 35 stays a year in starwood hotels. \nfirst, the positive, everybody is indeed nice and the hotel and the rooms are superb.\nHowever, I think the hotel has a serious issue in following up and and executing on guest's requests.\nI'll just state a few problems that we experienced:\nWhen we arrived on Tuesday, our room was not ready (not a problem in itself), I was asked for my cell number and were told I would be called when the room is ready. I also requested a crib or small bed for my son.\nWe were also told the hotel was giving us a small gift for our 10th wedding birthday. We never received anything (not that we care, but if you say you will do something, do it or don't say anything).\nWe came back around 4:30pm. The room was ready (but we were never called).\nWe get in the room and our son's bed was not there.\nWe leave around 5:00pm for an early dinner. I request the bed again to make sure we can put our son to bed upon our return.\nWe return 8:30pm and no bed. 9:15pm was when we had the bed ready in the room.\nI go get a bottle of sparkling water in the fridge and find in the bar a bottle already open and half empty.\nthe inflatable bed we were provided was leaking air, was 3/4 deflated in the morning and my son felt 3 times during the night (try to sleep on a high, deflating bed).\nIn the morning I signal the issue of the deflating bed. They come and pick up the bed, say they will bring a new bed. \n5pm no bed. My wife request another time the bed before leaving for dinner.\nWe come back 8:30pm, no bed and have to call again to have it.\nThursday - we notice that house keeping threw away our breakfast coupons left on the night table. I requested some new ones. House keeping also got the great idea of storing all the pillow in a closet where my wife was hanging her dresses, so the results is that the bottom half of the dresses are just laying on the pillow. Not helpful in trying to keep your clothes nice and wrinkle-free. A suggestion: move the clothes or store the pillows somewhere else.\nAnd last but not least, why would the staff knock on our door at 10:45pm to give us the bottles of water for the turn-down.

It is well laid out, clean and quiet, and as a business traveller it has more than I would normally expect. But without doubt the staff shine, their close knit teamwork results in the highest levels of service to their guests.\nRooms - I have stayed in the normal rooms and the suites. Both types are spacious, clean and comfortable and have all the amenities I require. The suites are divided into two areas (sleeping & lounge) separated by the bathroom. They have two flat screen TVs, settee, armchair, coffee table, work desk, free internet (wifi & wire), table lamp, ergonomic chair (very few hotels have these and it really helps when you're working). There is also a microwave, coffee machine, fridge, iron and ironing board. The beds have a facility to change the softness levels of the mattress and a duvet. The bathrooms are spacious with a full size mirror, good water pressure, and plenty of towels. \nYou can request a room exercise kit if you don't want to go to the gym, and an exercise video. A great idea (I keep promising myself that I'll get around to asking for one... one day!). The swimming pool is out the front of the hotel, it is a good size and has a jacuzzi. It overlooks the carpark, but you're not in a resort so it does very nicely for what it is. It is clean, well maintained and there are plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas.\nThe hotel is set back from the freeway but very little noise can be heard. Mostly guests are individual business travellers and many are regulars or here on longer stays so it's relatively quiet .\nBreakfast is a buffet with a really good choice and excellent value for money. 3 or 4 types of milk (including Soya) to put on your choice of a dozen different cereals, half a dozen different fruits (always a large bowl of strawberries), a good selection of yoghurts, oatmeal, pastries, bagels (6 varieties), croissants, plus a cooked breakfast buffet with bacon, eggs, hash browns, omlettes, waffles etc. Free newspapers at breakfast. \nRoom Service - good choice, good quality and good value for money. \nLounge in Reception - nicely laid out, feels homely even though you're just off the lobby. Comfortable to sit and work if you're here on weekends. Plus there is complimentary tea/coffee available all day.\nThere is a small shop selling all those things that you might have forgot or, if you're on a longer stay, run out of such as hairspray, toothpaste etc. Also has wine, salads, microwave meals if you want to cook your own, cold drinks, etc.\nHotel bus - a real plus. The hotel run a free shuttle bus service to anywhere within a 5 mile radius. They take bookings for office runs in the morning when it is busiest so saves messing with hire cars and taxis. To come back to the hotel at the end of the day you either book a time in advance or just ring up when you're ready to be collected. It's like having a personal chauffeur. They will drop / collect you at restaurants, shops (Memorial Mall), wherever within the radius. \nStaff - you can stay in the best hotel in the world but if the staff are haphazard or surly then your stay is marred or even ruined. I've travelled all over the world and in an average year, spend 150-180 nights in hotels. I can honestly say that this hotel has one of the best staff teams I've ever encountered. I won't name them all because I'm bound to miss someone, but when you have Nancy or La-La starting to worry about whether you've returned to the hotel at your regular time, or when the breakfast team give you a hug, then you know that the team really do care. They all take a great pride in their work, in looking after their guests, and they really do work as a team. Hilton - take note, your other properties could learn a thing or two from this team.\nDownsides - of course there are some:\n- Air conditioning units can be a bit noisy and draughty. They are next to the bed, but if they were at the other end of the room it would be better.\n- Makeup mirror - would be good to have a magnifying mirror, but it's not a big deal.\n- Room safe - plenty of space to put one, so would be good to have.\n- In-room coffee facilities are good for coffee - but not good for tea. Tea needs boiling water and it shouldn't be put through a coffee machine because it taints the taste (you can tell I'm from the UK). An in-room kettle would be great. And I'm sure if I had ever bothered to ask for one, it would have been immediately forthcoming.", "author": {"username": "SKA_York_UK", "num_cities": 8, "num_helpful_votes": 9, "num_reviews": 9, "num_type_reviews": 9, "id": "943D9603D1F0B52FA7B7621880783F3A", "location": "London, UK"}, "date_stayed": "November 2010", "offering_id": 1158926, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "November 20, 2010", "id": 87663063, "via_mobile": false}

On the other hand, the \"open\" concept does not provide for much privacy and the lighting was not good for my wife putting on makeup. Overall the lighting is very low and more moody than functional.

The staff was superb. From the doorman, bellmen, reception, butler (yes, you have a butler!) bartenders, you name it, all of them catered to our every need. The rooms were fabulous and so comfortable. We were in a king suite that had every conceivable luxury you could think of. We especially loved the integrated mirror tv in the bathroom. The beds were supremely comfortable and the room was so dark and quiet that we ended up sleeping until well past 9 every morning! Our only one complaint about the room would be that since the tub/shower is a walk-in, the door did not fully seal and every time we took a shower water would literally flood out of the back onto the floor. We just placed a bunch of towels down and tried not to walk around in socks! The second story bar closed by midnight on the weekdays so get there early if you want to try it out. We went up 2 times and were turned away each night. We did however have the absolute BEST manhattan I've ever had at the lobby bar. We had the unfortunate luck of being there during one of the hottest days of the year (over 100 degrees) when the hotel lost power. We had been walking all day and were trying to get ready for dinner at Daniel so it was a huge bummer since the shower was cold but the room was steamy, we did have emergency lighting (at the time) but no electricity so I had to just take a cold shower, pull my hair back, throw on my dress and try to get out of the room ASAP. It was also raining like crazy! The staff was keeping their composure under ALOT of pressure. Kudos to the doorman who tried his darnedest to grab us a cab. Unfortunately we ended up having to settle for an $80 rickshaw ride. TIP: If you decide to take a rickshaw, make SURE you negotiate and agree on a price before getting in. We thought we had calculated the cost of the ride based on his posted rates, only to find out that in SUPER small print were the terms \"rate is per person\". Dinner at Daniel was fabulous but when we returned to the hotel, ALL of the power was out, including the emergency lighting. We hurried up and got changed and hit the bar right next to the hotel that seemed to have escaped the power outage somehow.

There also was no fridge but there was a mini-bar on a sensor tray on top of chest of drawers which looked ridiculous and incongruous. We did find a card that said a fridge was available if required.

On the other hand, the breakfast staff was wonderful, greeted us warmly and visited with both of my children.\nOverall, it was a great experience. The hotel is clean and the lobby is beautiful!

There are 2 resturants, a bar and a coffee shop on site. Now the bad. The hotel hosts many conventions over the weekend. The convention goers sometime forget that there are other guest. Saturday evening, the room across from ours decided to host a party that went from 9PM to after midnight. We needed to get up early Sunday morning and did so with little sleep. Unfortunately Sunday night the party started again at 9PM. I went to the front desk to explain the situation. The front desk person contacted security since the hotel has a no room party policy. The front desk also suggested moving to another room, which was not appealing since we had been there 5 days. The front desk person went with me back to my room to check out the noise. When we got off the elevator you could hear the noise and as we neared my room the front desk person said \" You need to change rooms!\" So at 10PM on a Sunday night, we moved to a different room. The night manager took care of Sunday nights room charge. The bottom line here is they make alot of money off conventions so they won't inconvience them, just the family guy in a single room.", "author": {"username": "djrmar", "num_cities": 21, "num_helpful_votes": 10, "num_reviews": 32, "num_type_reviews": 16, "id": "FE2A87741EA5C909CD1E134A0609E65C", "location": "Columbia,TN"}, "date_stayed": "July 2012", "offering_id": 282699, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "August 2, 2012", "id": 136056145, "via_mobile": false}

Room very nice. \nOnly disappointment was the staff....I always get a king bed room,and that's what I reserved, but they gave me a room with 2 doubles. ?

The parking garage was mostly empty, the hallways and lobby deserted, come on. No need for bs like that.) He transfers me to the front desk who tell me, well, we'll see if we have any king bed rooms....WHAT? EXCUSE ME, but I booked a king bed room, I'm on your frequent stayer (Starwood ) program, the hotel is half empty! So now I raise the tone of my voice just a tad and say, Pardon me, I booked a king room, I expect a king room. {Geez it's not like I booked on hotline or something...I booked thru the hotel website!) Finally they come up with a king bed room. At that point things get better...they bring me the key and the rest of the stay is uneventful.\nThe only other issue is, don't park on level 4 of the garage, because the hotel elevator only goes to level 3.

I booked the \"Ti Amo\" package in a room which features a room with views of Citycentre plaza and downtown Houston. The package includes room, a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, breakfast for 2 at Alex Bistro, and complementary valet parking. Normally I have been let down in the past with other establishments as they do not follow the package. I have found myself calling the front desk asking where my stuff is.. but I am excited to report that everything went SMOOTHLY at hotel Sorella! I have to say the most difficult thing I had to do was find the place. It is tricky to find the main entrance. After finding the front entrance, I proceeded to use the valet parking service. No problems there. I was directed to the side elevator which takes you to the 2nd floor where the lobby is located. There were 3 other people being helped but I did not wait long at all. Upon checking in, they gave my the keys etc.. and presented an envelope with my voucher for the free breakfast for 2 at Alex Bistro. That was easy! I went to my suite on the 9th floor and was very pleased with the room. It was big and clean and very comfortable. It had a great view as well. Just as described on the hotels' website. I was very surprised at the level of cleanliness.. no hairs, dust, or wrappers. It was spotless! About 30 minutes after checking in, the champagne and strawberries arrived! Again I was pleased that they actually followed through on everything I was expecting without me having to \"remind\" them. Later in the evening after returning from a movie at Studio Movie Grill, I had a welcome card with a bottle of red wine and 2 glasses waiting for us!!! That was unexpected but very welcomed!!! We really enjoyed it! This morning we woke up excited to have breakfast at Alex Bistro. We got there around 9:30 and it was not very busy. We got seated immediately and our waiter was very friendly. I asked if there was a value/limit for our voucher and he said no, just as long as you don\u2019t order 7 courses! So basically order as you normally would. :) The coffee was great and food was good too. We gave him our voucher, tipped, and left. Easy process! I am giving Hotel Sorella a perfect 5 stars because everything was perfect! No complaints on the room, the cleanliness, and the staff was great! Always courteous and greet you by last name. I would highly recommend staying here whether for business or pleasure. There are plenty of restaurants and entertainment nearby and you will feel well taken care of.

I left my Iphone charger at home and one of the gentlemen at the desk checked to see if he had his personal one with him and loaned it to me until I could get to the Apple Store the next day. I needed to go to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal and the Bellhop/Valet dealt with not only getting me a cab but making sure they knew where I needed to go and how to get there (not all cabs want to go to Brooklyn evidently).\nQuiet - this is a largely residential section and believe it or not cabs and trucks and such incur LARGE fines if they lay on their horns. So much for that NY stereotype but I've stayed on 42nd and not gotten a lot of sleep, so I enjoyed the quiet. \nConvenient - three blocks to Central Park - right by Strawberry Fields. Three blocks a different direction to the 72 street subway stop for 1,2 and 3 lines. 3 is an express that will get you to Times Square (where you can transfer to about any other subway line) and all the Broadway shows and on down to the 9/11 memorial stop. 1 or 2 will get you to 50th street stop for Radio City, 30 Rock, Rockefeller Plaza etc. 3 or 4 blocks the opposite direction from Central Park is the Hudson Riverfront. Lots of restaurants in the area, lots of shopping up and down Broadway. Don't remember one in the property itself, or room service, but didn't look because with the kitchenette I didn't need one. Used the computers, very helpful to have free WiFi in the rooms too (seriously why don't all hotels have this now?). Believe there was a pool because I saw kids in bathing suits but I didn't check it out.\nThis hotel was recommended to me by a friend who resides in the neighborhood and I'm so glad I took his advice. 4 people from work have stayed at this hotel at various times this summer and we all plan to make this our regular NYC hotel from now on.", "author": {"username": "Dianeinla", "num_cities": 11, "num_helpful_votes": 17, "num_reviews": 16, "num_type_reviews": 8, "id": "93D490D8984DE583ECE65564A2399C02", "location": "Sherman Oaks"}, "date_stayed": "September 2012", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 3, "date": "October 2, 2012", "id": 141861906, "via_mobile": false}

While being located on a busy street, the entrance is on a small lane (Library Way?) which makes for quiet entry and exit. When you first walk in, you are not sure what to do. There is no front desk, but one natural gravitates towards a cluster of what look like empty computer stations, where seconds later a young man greeted us. Oddly, there don't seem to be any women working at this hotel! We had arrived a few hours before check-in and the room wasn't ready but they stored our luggage (in what turned out to be not a very secure location by the front door but with no mishaps), and we went to explore NYC. \nThe room was then ready when they said it would be, and once again we weren't really sure about things once we got in the room. It's all very understated. We had a suite with a nice master bedroom, and small living room with a kitchenette that took us a moment to find (sleekly hidden behind cupboard doors). The LR room has an understated wabi sabi feel too it that might have been better in concept as the linen on the custom couch was quite soiled. But it folded out (with some effort) to a fabulous sleep sofa for the kids. It was as comfortable and plush as any regular king size bed, which is saying alot for a sofa bed! Behind the couch was a low table with rolling chairs. Again we were unsure about the concept but it turned out to be an excellent dining table/desk. Best of all the unit had a balcony. A balcony in the middle of NYC! It took us a while to figure out the lighting (the master switch doesn't mean master bedroom, it means universal as in turning all lighting on and off), which was a little underdone. Every room could have used more light. A lot more light. The bathroom is done in very dark slate, and with barely any light, it felt very cave light. \nThe next day we were dying for some wine without a liquor store in a 4 block radius, which was easily solved by a chat with one of the many metrosexual men milling about who quickly supplied us with ample portions. There is a Panera and many little eateries, as well as the Grand Central Station locale, close by.\nSo while this hotel makes you realize you aren't really as cool as you think you are, it truly is a fabulous little find. The service is quick and friendly even if you don't know how to access it - help always seemed to find us. The location is just fantastic. As previously mentioned, they could do with some upgrades, particularly to soft surfaces (really that couch made me think of the light they use on the hotel makeover shows to illuminate the gross stuff you don't want to know about), and improve lighting. They also cheaped out on the floors a little bit, installing a plastic laminate in the hotel rooms and a poorly laid carpet in hallways. It would be nice if these were upgraded. But the spacious lay-out and good value for $, would make me go back.

It was 103 degrees when we landed in NY and we were looking forward to calm oasis of The Chatwal in midtown while seeing a few plays. As always, they welcome you back and seem to remember you from the last time. We got an upgrade through our travel agent and had a king deluxe room overlooking the street. We went to the theatre that first night and when we got back to the hotel after a late dinner, it seemed a tad warm but chalking it up to a brutally hot day in the city, we went to sleep. Somewhere in the middle of the night, we realized the AC wasn\u2019t really working and by the time we got up in the morning, the lights were blinking on and off. I took a quick shower but by the time my husband stepped into the shower, the water wasn\u2019t working as well. We called the front desk and they told us there was a power issue, not just for them but the whole block and they were dealing with it. Over the course of the next day and a half, the hotel and the entire block lost all power except for emergency lights and elevator. The hotels across the street were sending people elsewhere as the entire street was now cordoned off. \nDuring this time, the staff and management couldn\u2019t have been better. We decided to tough it out and they bent over backwards to make sure we were as comfortable as possible. Cases of water were sent to our room and we decadently showered in Fiji water! Buckets of ice and wine were sent to ease our stress and although we stayed away by virtue of seeing a bunch of plays, every time we came back, they checked on us. They brought in emergency generators, they gave us fans to use when we finally had some power but not full AC and I know they worked round the clock because we returned at 2AM one night, both the general manager and director of operations were still there on the street talking to Conn Ed and trying calm everyone\u2019s nerves at the same time. By 3 AM that night, all was restored and we slept in a cool room. When we went downstairs the next morning, we were approached by both managers who wanted to know what they could do to compensate us for our troubles. They completely stepped up to the plate by not only comping us the night but also by upgrading us to a suite and sending us to the spa. All for a situation that was entirely out of their control.\nMind you, we are no VIP guests to them, just a couple of people who like their hotel. And because of this amazing attention to service, we are now diehard fans. Are there cheaper midtown hotels in the area that are nice?

The Asprey amenities are great, and the minibar was well-stocked and priced to be used. We had drinks and met a friend at the second-floor bar, a great spot for casual conversation. All around, the staff were friendly and went out of their way to meet our needs.

There was little room to maneuver around the bed, and this seems more in line with the standard NYC hotel than a luxury hotel. Considering this place has nightly rates that can be $600 or more, I wouldn't expect even the smallest room to be this small.\n-The bed was not the most comfortable. While the linens are very good, the bed here was a bit too firm for us.\nA major problem:\n-Noise control. In the bathroom, we could hear the conversation of those in the room above us. When I say \"hear,\" I don't mean that I could hear muffled talking or whatever - little stuff like that wouldn't bother me. I mean I could hear every single word that was said, and it was more than a little awkward/uncomfortable.

It starts the minute you pull up to the Sherry\u2026 A very friendly doorman (absolutely no attitude, just a friendly soul!) greets you and escorts you to the front desk. The lobby is small, but so elegant and warm. You instantly know that you are in the land of \u2018old money\u2019. If Bernie Madoff was not in jail, you would expect him to walk out of Cipriani\u2019s and take the elevator up to his apartment! This building is only 50 rooms dedicated to hotel guests; the rest of the 30+ floor building is soley dedicated to owners. Currently, there are apartments selling for around $10,000,000! \nOur room was large and spacious. We paid to upgrade to a bit larger room with a view of the carriages and statue at the end of Central Park. It is also fun to wake up and walk 20 steps to the CBS Early Show... Unless there's a big name concert going on, don't worry about getting there super early. There were never more than 50-75 people there. \nWe were greeted by Lori Ann at the front desk. What a kind soul! She asked how our flight was and if she could do anything at all to help us feel more settled. I mentioned to her and to the doorman that my cellular phone had gone missing in the airport limo to the hotel and they were seemingly as upset for me, as I was! When Tammy (also a front desk superstar employee!) came on to shift, she heard about my phone missing and was quick to give me advice. She told me to offer a reward (bribe?!) to the dispatcher/driver and see if that would help my phone suddenly show up (driver had been saying that my phone was not in his town car!). Mysteriously, after I took Tammy\u2019s advice, and offered the \u2018reward\u2019, at 12:41 AM, my phone showed up. The bellman was so nice and even though it was late, he called me to let me know it was safe and sound at the front desk and would be delivered to me in the morning. \nThe Sherry gives you a well stocked bathroom! Shaving Creme, Razor, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, All the Toiletries You Will Need (except for hairspray). There is also bottled water, complimentary, as well as free wi-fi. \nThe gym is small but good. However, you walk SOOO much in NYC, it is doubtful that you will spend anytime in it.\nThis hotel is such a shining star! You feel like royalty, but somehow, the Sherry team never displays that stuffy attitude that I have experienced with other high end hotels. \nOur room was lovely and we feel blessed to have so much space in a city that almost prides itself on tiny spaces.\nAlso, when I mentioned to one of the staff that the price of food was a bit mind blowing in NYC, they suggested that we go to Gene\u2019s Coffee Shop, right around the corner! Yay! What a helpful hint! We had GREAT food, and never spent more than $20!! That was for two people! I told one of my friends back home that I felt like I got \u2018one over\u2019 on the City! Ha! Make sure that you walk out of the hotel, go right at 60th and walk 1.5 blocks and look for Gene\u2019s! You will LOVE it! Great Food\u2026GREAT prices! Also, remember that Gene\u2019s delivers to the Sherry, for FREE! Almost every morning, my mom and I had a hot egg white veggie omelet with crispy, HOT French fries delivered to our room. The delivery was always here within 20 mins! \nIf you want a great tour, be sure to take a peek at PhotoTrek tours. This website is linked on the Sherry\u2019s website and it is worth EVERY penny! Marc is the talented prof\u2019l photographer that owns PhotoTrek tours and you will adore this tour! Try to get the 3 hour tour, if possible.\nThe Sherry is magical! The location is PERFECT! The staff is even more perfect! You will be so sad when you have to check out since you will feel like you\u2019re saying goodbye to family. \nHurry home to the Sherry Netherland!

Our first night in Houston was at the St. Regis. We decided to stay at the Westin the 2nd night because it is brand new, not too far from downtown, and had a good rate. We loved the property even though it seemed deserted. I'm sure they are still trying to get the word out about themselves. The lobby and public spaces were beautiful and modern. Our room was a typical Westin room with amazing beds and a great tv. I was a bit diappointed as the shower and tub were not separate like in most Westins I've stayed in. We greatly enjoyed the Executive Lounge with wonderful snacks and a decent breakfast. The pool and fitness center on the 18th floor were really cool. We enjoyed the view of Houston from up there. The pool was a bit chilly and hot tub not warm. Maybe they can work those kinks out. The Il Mulino restaurant was amazing. We were the only people in the whole place. But, I loved my chicken piccata and their award winning meatballs. The hotel is in a great location with Target, Cheesecake Factory, and Memorial City Mall across the street. The valet was helpful. No one really offered to help with luggage. At check-in, the gentleman was cordial but not genuinely friendly. He was a bit stiff and quite consumed with the rules such as asking to see my AAA card, telling me I'd probably not get SPG points since we held the room with my friend's credit card even though it was booked in my name and paid for in cash, and letting us know we had to use our room keys to access the elevator.

Although the hotel is a very nice property, it did not come close to our expectations for a \"Category 7\" hotel. We requested an upgrade a couple of weeks before our stay and informed a \"front office supervisor\" that we would be celebrating a special birthday. He responded promptly and said he would do his best to obtain an upgrade but could make no promises. Our reservation was for a \"grand deluxe\" 400-square foot room. At check-in, we were advised that we had been \"upgraded\" to a larger room (but not a suite) on the tenth floor. The room, in fact, was the bedroom of a suite and had a locked, adjoining door to the suite itself. It had two windows, but limited natural light and no view to speak of. One of the first things we noticed was that the occupants of the suite kept trying the adjoining door to our room (presumably assuming it belonged to their suite). This was a bit unsettling from a security standpoint. The room was luxuriously appointed but did not appear to me to measure anywhere near 400 square feet. The bathroom had 2 sinks, a heated toilet (which held no appeal to us in 90+ degree weather), a TV built into the mirror, and a rainshower tub/jacuzzi (but not very much room for toiletries). The bedroom had a sitting area, desk, and coffee table, with a good selection of interesting magazines. The major disappointment we had was that the so-called \"lap pool\" was not a lap pool at all. I would call it a \"plunge pool\" at best. The spa attendants referred to it as a \"resistance pool\"--it is the type of pool that would be installed in a luxury condominium unit that does not have the space for a \"real\" pool. I tried it out (very skeptically) as I am a devoted lap swimmer and found that I could not take more than one stroke before being pulled back to the wall of the pool. I am sure there is an art to mastering this type of pool, but it is not for real swimmers. The picture of the pool on the website makes it look much larger than it is and, when I mentioned this to the spa attendants, they laughed (good naturedly) and said they did not understand how it could have been so misrepresented. All in all, our one-night stay for an occasion that we hoped would be quite memorable was nothing special. Perhaps it was naive of me to expect the level of luxury that we had encountered in such properties as Tambo del Inka in Urubamba, Peru, the Rambagh Palace in Jaipur, the Park Hyatt Palacio Duhau in Buenos Aires, the Nadesar Palace in Varanasi, the Taj Mahal in Mumbai, and even the ITC Maurya in New Delhi and the ITC Mughal in Agra.

My first impressions were great. I thought the location near Times SQ would make it really noisy, but it's actually set far back enough from the action that you're not really affected by the hustle and bustle of the square. The hotel's proximity to 42nd St station and Grand Central make it perfect for getting around NYC. We had a little trouble with our credit card when we checked in: the staff tried to put a 'hold' for the total cost of our stay on it, as is normal practice, but it was being declined (my bank thought it was a fraudulent purchase and stopped my card). However the staff were so pleasant and understanding about the situation- not snooty at all- and gave me the time to sort everything out. The room was phenomenal. We stayed in a suite which came with a butler! To be honest we didn't use him much, but it was great to know that he was there. The concierge was super, printing out all of our boarding passes for us the day before departure and putting them under our door, and the reception staff, especially Elizabeth and Catalina, were the most friendly hotel staff I have come across in a long time. We were even loaned a laptop for the duration of our stay. I think a lot of hotels forget simple things, like remembering the name of guests, smiling, and being genuinely helpful. The Chatwal had all this perfected and it made this a truly great stay. The only reason i haven't given this hotel a full five stars (although I'd like to give it 4.5 out of 5, but TripAdvisor doesn't allow that) is because the control panel for the lighting/curtains in the room was a little complex and confusing and on a couple details didn't work.

The facility was wonderful, and the staff was well-trained and helpful. What I enjoyed most was the location, because I could get easy access to the convention building through the skywalk instead of walking in the heat in my high heels. There are several nice hotels within a few blocks from the convention center; however, considering the extremely cool air in the conference hall and the heat outdoor, even one block makes a different! The hotel is also steps away from the Green and the lake park (a very cute but small park), and it is two blocks away from the grocery store and a few blocks from the Tunnel (lots of shops and dinning underground). Downtown Houston has many luxury hotels, but I saw many homeless people wandering around in downtown. I consider Hilton America a nicer and safer location.\nThere are fine dining and bars on site as well, which provides more options and convenience to the guests. The gym has a great sky view, and the swimming pool is on top floor. \nThere was only one disappointment. My former colleague dropped me a gift bag at the concierge. I forgot to pick it up that day, and it was lost when I went to pick my bag the following morning. Although the concierge patiently helped me to search for the bag and followed up by phone calls, I didn\u2019t receive my bag at the end. \nOverall, I enjoyed the location, the welcoming staff, and the comfortable bed.

There was even this one instance when, one morning, we leave the room and someone from the staff whom I had yet not met before already knew my name as he wished us a very nice day. I found that to be a very nice human touch.\nAs for the room, it was simply gorgeous and every aspect of it said abundance, class, and comfort. And as a man, I really enjoyed some of the more luxurious touches such as the hidden HD tv in the bathroom mirror and the heated toilet seat/bidet.\nWhat we also noticed was that the room was cleaned not once, but twice every day so when we'd be coming back to the room after a full day of shopping or an evening on the town, the room would always look perfectly fresh. Just as though it was our first time entering it over and over again.\nSo this is it for my first hotel review.

I know the Doormen by name, they know me. It's nice to arrive in a city not your own and be greeted with a hearty How you doin Mr. Thompson, you feel like family here. The rooms are all Unique, each one decorated by the owner. No expense is spared though.

The beds are divine, the shower/bathroom luxurious. The concierge was wonderfully helpful. The front desk was prompt. But I have to go back to the customer service, and especially the valet. Our group was renting more than 5 company SUVs, two box trucks containing valuable film equipment, and a stakebed, and they handled the chaos without batting an eye. Even when we occasionally lost valet tickets or had delays in loading gear and held up the clockwork precision of the front of house parking. I can't recommend the hotel enough, especially based on this.\nNot to rave too long, but I have to include this example of the insane level of customer service: I was walking through the lobby to my room after working all night, and carrying a smoothie I had just picked up from a local restaurant for breakfast. I asked the front desk a question and accidentally dropped my smoothie and spilled it all over the lobby (to my utter embarrassment). After trying to help mop up and being shooed away, I made it upstairs to my room and got a phone call exactly five minutes after unlocking the door. It was room service. They politely stated that they understood I had dropped a smoothie that was full, and could they replace it for me with a new one on the house?

The expo. extends into the hotel's side lobby, too.

This 5 ring circus goes on very unobtrusively to each of the rings. They have meeting rooms suitable for 12 to 675 people.\nCost: guest room conference price is very low, quality very high. I don't know how much they charge the society for the 3 days of space & the banquet with wine, but you can judge by the fact that it's a non-profit society & this is their annual fund raiser. It has to be reasonable.\nBusiness travelers will appreciate the large guest room, free WiFi everywhere, 2 phones w/ data port, voicemail & oversized work desk. Business center & fitness center, both key accessed. Very nice pool, patio, hot tub. Poolside guest rooms have private patios.

I was in town for a business conference. This was one of the best properties I've ever stayed at and the conference was served by the staff as well as I've ever seen. The hotel is nice and clean. The staff are incredibly attentive and friendly, from the front desk, to the restaurant, to the housekeepers to the banquet staff. Very impressive. They have been trained well.\nThe room was comfortable and well lit and had most of the amenities you would need. One downside to the rooms is that there was no refrigerator. But the bed was comfortable and the room was quiet even though the hotel was pretty full.\nOn the down side, on three different floors, none of the vending machines were fully functional. That's not a big deal, but it did factor in one fairly significant way. The hotel does not provide bottled water in the rooms. The water out of the tap in the bathroom was lukewarm. And, as mentioned, there was no refrigerator. So, if you want cool drinking water, you're at the mercy of the vending machines.\nThe hotel was a bit on the pricey side, so even though it was very nice, it may not be a good option for budget travelers. And then when you add the fact that breakfast is not included, other properties (notably the Embassy Suites across the street) start to look like better options financially.\nAlso, the hotel is handicapped a bit by its location. I found that there isn't much going on downtown after 5 PM and there aren't many (any) reasonably priced restaurants downtown that are open for dinner. So if you're without transportation, plan on spending a good bit on meals. But if you need to be downtown (e.g., especially for an event at the convention center) it is a very convenient location. And it seemed to be a relatively safe location, as well.\nAll in all, my experience was great. But it was a little pricey and there are limited options for meals or other things to do outside the hotel. So, overall, I can just rate it four stars even though, if you don't mind the price and need to be downtown, it is a super option.", "author": {"username": "arkyscott", "num_cities": 6, "num_helpful_votes": 3, "num_reviews": 6, "num_type_reviews": 6, "id": "D2CC0E117D835E545F23CD71EE8B2B0D", "location": "Little Rock, AR"}, "date_stayed": "July 2012", "offering_id": 282699, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "July 14, 2012", "id": 134370894, "via_mobile": false}

I travelled with my husband, 6 year old daughter and 20 year old nephew...as frequent travellers, we bring our daughter everywhere with us and she always rates the hotels. She compared the Chatwal to many other 5+ stars and we all agreed that we would return. Our nephew appreciated the art deco design and loved the tv in the mirror. He also liked the location as it was steps from Times Square, but my husband also noted how quiet and serene it was at night in the hotel (it was hard to believe we were in the middle of Times Square when we were in our room). We didn't have any issues with noise which was nice!\nCheck-in:\nThe staff at the Chatwal are all so professional and friendly, and most of all helpful. Prior to my arrival, the Concierge staff (Nick, Tim, Juan, Pierre) emailed me with hotel, weather, and local information as well as answered all of my questions and arranged for everything that was requested, including accepting packages and making reservations for dining/transportation, etc. Check-in with Catalina was literally 5 minutes and we were in our room with our luggage and a tour of the room right away. \nWhen I was out and about during the day, I was able to email concierge with any requests or questions and they were always answered almost immediately or in a timely manner. Thanks so much to everyone at Concierge!\nStaff:\nOur butler, Brandon, was most efficient and even had delicious treats for my daughter pre-dinner...it was perfect and she lasted until we were settled and decided on a place to dine at. He was available to greet us either in the lobby or seen in the hallways, and most of the staff remembered us all by first names. \nThe cleaning staff were all efficient and no complaints whatsoever - fresh towels were provided daily and replenished at night if needed. Doorstaff are always available to flag down a cab or arrange for transportation.\nRoom:\nThe room was extremely spacious and amenities well-thought of. You can be assured that all of the little details are taken care of - from the umbrella in the closet, to the computer phone, to the spacious storage and snack bar, different types of hangers in the closet as well as lint remover, shoe horn, laundry bag, etc. Plenty of hanging storage, and chest of drawers are provided.\nA list of amenities that can be requested from your butler is available in the guest info book. The suede walls, and soft carpet was a nice touch and I'm sure doubled as a noise-buffer for the rooms. Complimentary shoe shines are offered daily and the mini bar included shakers, gourmet snacks and a wide range of beverages/alcohol, and many magazines are stored with the mini bar. \nThe motorized drapes are controlled by the computer phone but we had them closed most of the time. The desk also turned into a make-up vanity and media centre which you can use as a charging station or computer work area. \nBeds:\nThe beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and the turn-down service great. The reading lights at the side of the bed are handy.\nEnsuite:\nThe bathroom design is important, and we always look for a hotel with somewhat luxurious bathrooms. This bathroom included contemporary Kohler fixtures including a heated bidet seat, tv in the mirror by the vanity and an extensive amenities box. The speakers on the ceiling make it easy to hear the tv while in the bath or shower. Shower options include a handheld, rain shower head, and tub with spa jets. The Asprey products are one of our favourites too. The entire bathroom is tiled in a sparkly, Black Galaxy granite which gives a nice glamourous/luxurious feel.\nRobes and slippers are also provided.\nDining Options:\nRoom service is available 24 hours a day, 2nd floor lounge provides refreshments and snacks + bar, and dinner at the Lamb's Club is a must!\nOther:\nWe all commented on the elevator access (each guest has to scan their card before the elevator would work) which made us feel safe. You will learn more about the hotel's history during your overview of the room, and most of the movies playing in the elevator had some sort of connection to the hotel.\nAs you enter the elevator area in the lobby, you will find refreshments (iced-tea for us) and a quaint sitting area. The spa and pool were under renovations during our stay, but we were told that spa and pool access could be arranged at one of the hotel's partner sites. We didn't take advantage of this as our stay wasn't long enough to do so. \nThe gym was extremely clean, a little small but had a bike, treadmills, elliptical and free-weights, a bench and exercise ball, towels and bottled water, and yoga mats. If you forget your ipod you can borrow one from the hotel or grab a pair of earphones for the tv's.\nComplimentary wifi is available in each room, and ipods, ipads and laptops are offered for complimentary use at check-in. A Backgammon set is available in each room as well.", "author": {"username": "TO_Traveller_771", "num_reviews": 1, "id": "3FE2C35592C569B61C09C77C00076585", "location": "Toronto", "num_helpful_votes": 2}, "date_stayed": "July 2012", "offering_id": 1641016, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "July 11, 2012", "id": 134069397, "via_mobile": false}

One thing you can always count on at the Four Seasons, anywhere, is excellent service. Service was pretty great, but the property itself seems a little neglected. With that said, this is a rather tired Four Seasons. The room where I stayed--especially bathroom-- could stand to be updated to match other properties. Soundproofing between rooms as well as hallway also seemed to be lacking. \nThere were several weddings the weekend I arrived, so it was a bit chaotic, and staff seemed less attentive to us non wedding party people than usual. Understandable, I suppose. A nice amenity is the large outdoor pool w/jacuzzi and bar area. Some rooms lead directly to the pool with poolside patios. If you want some sun and fun, I recommend those rooms, which also provide 24 hr access to the area while others are restricted between late evening and early morning. The fitness room is also quite nice and was in the process of being refurbished at the end of my stay. \nA real negative for the hotel, that I have not experienced at other Four Seasons, was poor quality food. I ate in the somewhat touted restaurant and it was really mediocre, especially for the money. The menu items sounded good but the execution was less than pleasing: too creamy, too saucy, too salty, etc. I also ordered room service one morning and I was equally disappointed with the poor food quality. \nAnd, on a side note, I was charged $7 for an 8 ounce cup of coffee at the pool, when unknowingly, just steps away in the fitness room, there was free coffee and tea. I never signed for the coffee, so could not dispute it at the time. The staff did remedy this charge upon check out as they were in equal disbelief that this was the charge.

The couch and the over-sized chair were very comfortable, and despite the fact that we were facing two busy downtown streets the soundproofing was pretty effective.\nThe bathroom was at least half the size of the bedroom and contained a giant whirlpool tub (rectangular, not square, and quite comfy for two) and a separate walk-in shower with TWO heads, one rain shower head and the other with serious water pressure. They have tidy shampoo, conditioner and body wash dispensers in the shower so if you'd like (and I did!) you can just take the little bottles home untouched.\nWe ate at the restaurant downstairs, the Line and Lariat, and though the arrival of the entree was a little slow the food was very good and the waitstaff was courteous and attentive. We also ordered room service just before the kitchen closed and our selection was delivered promptly and tasted wonderful.\nThe valet was a little expensive at $28 a night, but much better than parking your car downtown someplace. \nThis place is definitely going to be our regular local getaway.

My main complaint about the room is that there seems to be paint flaking off here and there, and obviously due to the condition of the building. Not a huge deal, but something I feel that the staff should be meticulous about. The bathroom is huge, I enjoy having a shower room that is NOT part of the bathtub, and a large one at that. As a matter of fact, the bathroom seems to be the same size as the bedroom at where I stayed. \nI don't think I ever got to stay in the hotel when it is fully booked, so I am not sure how noisy it could get, but the other reason I liked the hotel is that it seems very quiet in the evening.

We were eagerly greeted by valets who were semi-informative on self-parking. During check-in, we were informed that our reservation had been made for the wrong day. Although the situation was easily fixed once we received the help from a busy manager, the front desk man who was doing his best was not doing much at all.\nThe physical appearance of the hotel was very captivating. The design was functional, and was complimented by the cleanliness of the hotel. The pleasing aesthetics of the room were not an overstatement. The room in which I stayed was one of the cleanest rooms I have seen in a hotel. Most of the guest service staff were willing to help and upheld friendly attitudes. \nWe didn't spend much time in the hotel due to the nature of our business trip. Most of our time spent in the hotel was after 10PM. We did not have a personal vehicle to travel downtown, nor did we have the energy to take a 25 minute cab ride. One unfortunate detail about this time of night in the area is that most businesses were closed after 9:30 PM. Inside the hotel the pool was closed, the adjoining restaurant was closed and the \"024 Lounge\" was a make-shift location for a business event due to everything else being closed (needless to say there was no room in the bar). We were made to feel as if we were intruding on a private event.\nMy colleagues and I are not of business formal appearance. Although we were either business casual or causally dressed, sneers did make their way across the room (mainly from hotel staff). From the moment of our arrival, our presence was continuously questioned. After returning from our event, we spent time lounging in the common areas. It was during this time that we were physically questioned by a judgmental security personnel while drunkenly, sloppy guests seemed to have more welcome. Although it was not an issue the first encounter, it began to disturb us once he continued to question into us being there (after we had to show our room key and provide our room number).\nWe enjoyed our stay at the Westin. The location of the hotel was conveniently located in relation to downtown Houston. Our room is very clean with all amenities provided, the hotel was up-kept by a wonderful custodial staff and the late-night room service staff was probably the most helpful personnel we encountered. I would stay again at the Westin Houston Memorial.\nIf you are considering this hotel for either business or leisure, I would inform you to not have high expectations if you are a \"night owl\", or work late evenings, with hopes to have something to do around the hotel location.

I set up my backdrop & lighting on Thursday night in what has always been a locked Ballroom. I always finish up my setup before the start of each show so as to not spook any dogs. On Fri before the show I found my lighting equipment stolen as well as the crate for my medical alert dog. I soon found out that other vendors who were set up in a different area than I was were robbed as well.\nThe staff could have cared less. The manager would not come to speak to us about this. We asked to see the security camera film. We were told \"We do not have security cameras because it would give our guests a false sense of security.\"\nI asked what they would say if it was a child that had been taken? Guess cameras would be a good idea then. Later on I heard their excuse was that criminals were suing them for taking their photo without permission. REALLY??? Cameras are on our highways, in stores, & a part of our life. I do not buy that one either.\nThere were panhandlers asking guest for money as they entered their rooms, walked their dogs, & even right outside the ballroom. The panhandlers were bothering guests throughout the whole weekend.\nWe asked the hotel staff about stopping the panhandlers, giving them a description & they said \"We do not want to approach someone who might be a guest & risk insulting them.\"\nHow about all the guests there who are already insulted by being robbed, harassed by panhandlers, etc? And the thefts took place over the whole weekend, it was not just one night. The manager, when he finally did come talk to us (I had to call cooperate for that to happen) Said he would pay the maintenance man to act as security at night. That went well. More thefts on Friday night. He was found sitting behind the front desk by my assistant when she went down for some Tums in the early morning hours. The doors by the ballroom with a sign that states \"Access by room key only from 11pm to 7am \" were duct taped & zip tied so they would not lock. I took photos of this. Bottom line is, the manager blamed us for the thefts. Said it was our fault. No concern what so ever for his guest or their safety.\nStaff service for your room? We got up on Sunday morning to make coffee in our room to find housekeeping had not cleaned the pot from the day before or turned it off. Coffee still in the pot and the light was blinking. They had put new cups in & replenished the coffee packets to make more. That is all. \nI have asked & asked for this hotel to do the right thing & replace my stolen equipment so I can do my job. I have been met with no sympathy or desire to do the right thing. Much less accept accountability. \nHelp from cooperate? Zero. They say it is a franchise & they have no control.

The gym was also spotless and had everything you could need for a road warrior.\nThe hotel had the feel of the ulitmate business traveler hotel with rooms that were silent as a tomb and limited traffic in the lobby. This is even more impressive considering it is in the heart of times square.\nThe reason this review is incomplete is as I attempted to sleep in this magnificent room I was repeatedly bit by a bug (I assume a mosquito). This went on all night and prevented me from getting a proper nights sleep. I called the front desk and the man attempted to be helpful and offered to go buy bug repellent for me which I declined as I felt silly.

We came to Manhattan for her to visit her uncle who lives here and to celebrate my older daughter's new first post college job in the area. My recent college graduate stayed with us several nights and commuted. It was a cinch for her to catch the subway to her job in Brooklyn in the Dumbo area. And the roomy suite made it easy for her to grab something to eat, have Nespresso coffee, have her shower in the amazing bathroom, read the paper, and get ready to venture out. The walk to the subway was also not bad, just down Fifth Avenue in Herald Square.\nOur suite is the perfect choice for this occasion. I booked a deluxe apartment suite, after considering booking a studio suite. I have been thrilled that I decided on the apartment suit due to the setup with a door separating the living room from the bedroom, giving us extra room to spread out and relax without disturbing whoever was resting. It comes with the most comfortable bed and bedding you could ask for. The duvet cover is of the softest, best quality I have seen. It is hard to force myself to get out of bed in the morning. It was also very convenient with the extra half bath for getting dressed and ready to depart.\nI was asked if I needed anything when we checked in. Immediately I was offered additional hangers, which came in handy because between us we had a lot of clothes for different things we were doing. There is a typical hotel closet AND an additional deep closet so everything fit perfectly. There are also 4 nice built in drawers and a ledge perfect for setting a suitcase on. There are two drawers in each nighhtstand, along with cordless phones on each side, a nice clock, dimmer switch lights on the lamps, as well as convenient outlets to charge phones on each side. The Samsung TV's in the bedroom and the living room were large and of high quality. Wifi access was free and reliable, which came in handy with all of our multiple devices and very much needed due to all of our separate coming and going.\nWhat was important to me above all was location and view. On both points this suite exceeds any expectation I had. We had meals in all corners of the city, visited museums, shopped, visited my brother's office and apartment, all via short cab ride, with the exception of an amazing ride in the Maserati to the Metropolitan museum that my 16 year old and I will not soon forget! I can't imagine an easier spot to use as a base in Manhattan. If traffic is stopped in one area, there are alternate routes. \nAs far as the view, one side of this bedroom has a large double floor to ceiling window towards the Hudson, facing Fifth Avenue, the other has a view of Fifth Avenue for many blocks, along with a perfect view of the Empire State building. Two sets of double windows in the separate living room give us additional views of that building, although wew have to look up to see the top.\nSo far, when I run out of bottled water, soft drinks, Nespresso pods or cream, all I have to do is call, and it appears, the Nespresso pods are replenished without any request. We have also received daily treats, like cookies and pretzels and the best popcorn I have ever eaten in my life (I think butter is involved!) delivered to the room, several times a day if we are in.\nI used the wonderful gym on the third floor this morning. They have a number of good weight machines, 6 or so good quality treadmills with tv's built in, and complimentary earbuds, chilled bottle water and even apples for guests.\nI really like the quality of all the furnishings. They are comfortable, understated, and clean. It is nice to have lots of surfaces for our purchases on from our shopping excursions on Fifth Ave. There is room under the table where the bedroom tv sits to slide your suitcases out of the way. I appreciate the floor to ceiling bookcases in both the bedroom and living room and all the art books placed there. The huge marbled bathroom with wonderful deep soaking tub, large glass enclosed separate large marble shower with great shower head and top quality decorative file was wonderful. The marble bathroom floors were cool, which I enjoyed, along with the wonderful floor to ceiling windows and nice blind system. There was even a thermostat driven floor heater to warm the marble floor in the bathroom as well as and a small orchid plant. The same floor to ceiling double windows brought beautiful light with a bonus view towards the Chrysler building into the bathroom, and there was great blinds for privacy. Everything has been thought of in the hotel.\nAnother plus of the apartment suite is the fridge and freezer. Manuela at the front desk gave us directions the first day to an organic market a few blocks away, and we stocked up with fruit and yogurt and another items. We also had leftovers from our restaurant meals so the fridge was perfect. We loved going during summer Restaurant Week, and really splurged. Again, the central location facilitated our ability to try restaurants in different neighborhoods, expanding convenient dining choices.\nI can't say enough about the service we are enjoying here. The doorman, the house car driver, the front desk staff, the housecleaning and supplies stockers were all very professional and very accommodating. Manuela at the front desk from Italy remembered my last name from the time I checked in, as did Ashley and Kimberly. They graciously provided an umbrella when it rained. I spoke to a security person named Rodney after we left to track down an item we could not find when we got home, and he took extra effort to help me, even calling me back promptly after he reserached the small item. I did not use the spa due to traveling with my 16 year old, but I did tour it. It is a very nice set up, very roomy and serene. Nice space, great amenities, you could spend a day here for sure. I hope to return with my husband and try it out. We also did not eat at the hotel restaurant but I did go down and have a drink with my older daughter one night in the bar. It had comfy sitting areas to enjoy the live jazz band which we very much enjoyed.\nBe sure and ask for a map at the front desk, it was a good map of Manhattan, with easy to follow info on the subway system and a magnified map on the back of the immediate area.\nI can't wait to come back to the Setai. I may not need a suite the next time for my husband and myself but I sure would prefer one!!!!!", "author": {"username": "Laurie L", "num_reviews": 3, "id": "C7E7DDC0881C7C39C767F82711D9B711", "location": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana", "num_helpful_votes": 1}, "date_stayed": "August 2012", "offering_id": 1776857, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "August 3, 2012", "id": 136170686, "via_mobile": false}

I was travelling with my two children (aged 12 and 8) so our needs are a bit different to when we are travelling as a whole family. The Beacon worked well for us - its more than a hotel room with a bit more space and the location is excellent as it just ten minutes away from the action, but not in a touristy area, so you feel like you are actually living in New York as oppose to holidaying. The beds were a bit smaller than I expected - I would say the two beds are more like King singles than doubles so it was a bit of a squash with an adult and a child in one bed and definitely would not work for two adults that need space. However the rooms are well laid out and have everything you need. Housekeeping is good and unlike others we had no problems with bugs or anything of that nature. The sitting room is of a good size and a welcome respite at the end of a busy day to be able to stock the fridge with a few drinks and chill without having to order room service etc. The area has plenty of nice local eateries (so cheap for someone coming from Australia) and the proximity to Central Park is a lovely walking/running start to any day. We did not eat in but there is a tiny kitchen with microwave and small cooker, so if you wanted to it would be practical to have light meals. There is a laundry on the 7th floor which is great especially as I put some laundry with the concierge on the first day and it call came back dry cleaned - even t shirts!! So having access to the laundry is great with kids etc. The rooms are also very reasonably priced for New York and the staff really helpful. Its not the sort of place if you are looking for a couples break with facilities on hand but if you are looking for a family hotel with more space than a hotel room, this is perfect. The staff are also very helpful in securing cabs, posting things, and generally helping.

The building that houses the Hotel (an old bank building), is awesome! I love a hotel with character. The room itself was also great... big, newly refurbished, awesome shower, big, fluffy towels, a comfortable bed, and very clean. This itself makes this a very good hotel. There were a number of misses... Not a reason to not select perhaps, but, depending on rate, maybe a reason to go elswhere. Too bad, Hotel Icon could be great. I mentioned the pluses, and there are many, so it has yhe \"bones\" to be great. But to be better thn the \"3 stars\" I would give now, here are the misses... Check in was okay. Valet and bellman, but oddly, no one asked to take or assist with luggage although we were the only one's checking in (I arrived with a co-worker, and meeting two others for a total of 4 rooms). Not a huge deal as I have no issue handling my own luggage, just odd of a hotel that can be better. After finding our way to the front desk (no one assisted getting us in) we started the check in process. No issue here really. I did find a couple of things again that were a miss... I asked for a high floor room (there are 10 or 11 floors), I was given a room on floor 4. Odd because this Hotel is a Marriott Autograph Collection Hotel and I am a silver member so I usually get the bascis in my profile. In addition, I was hosting a reception at a moderate cost in the hotel one of the nights. I didn't need an \"upgrade\", and did not ask for one, just a higher floor. I was told that \"this was all they could do\", politely, but nonethless this was it. When I got to the room, I truly thought it was great... I already mentioned the many pluses above. However as I opened the curtains to the two windows, I found myself looking at the side of an abondoned building and a parking lot. The view from a lower floor. So I proceeded back to the Front Desk and let the female clerk know I loved the room, but really wanted a higher floor. I made it clear I was willing to wait (we did check in early, around Noon, so I get all rooms are not ready yet). She did at least humor me and spent a minure or two looking for another room, she finally told me that was the best she could do. This ended up even more strange as one of my employees, who checked in later, was given a room on the 7th floor. Now I am not suggesting I should get a room better than someone I work with, but it did prove there were better rooms. And remeber, I am silver with Marriott Rewards, and I was hotting and paying for the reception. Just odd. Later in the day, my co-workers actually, unprompted by me, asked if my room had been upgraded or if I had received some sort of personal welcome (fresh fruit, welcome note, something), and when I said no, they were really surprised. I guess I was too. When I went back to the room that night, I noticed the curtains were closed, but nothing else had been done to the room. Was there turndown service? I woulkd have thought in an Autograph Collection Hotel it would be yes, and someone was there, but the coverlet on the bed was still there, and the dirty towel I used to shower earlier was still there as well, and nothing on the pillow (note, chocolate, etc.). Again, odd. Even stranger, on night two, the curtains were again closed, nothing else in the room serviced, and night 3 and 4 saw no one in the room. Is there turndown or not? There should be at this level of hotel, but I have no idea. Also of strange note, I removed the coverlet myself and placed in a pile on the chair in the room... it was never touched again. Not folded, not placed back on the bed, nothing. On day 2 I finally folded it neatly myself, placed it on one of the nightstands, and that is where it remained. Again, the room was always clean, the bed made, towels refreshed, but then there were these misses. Another miss... I am not a huge consumer of the mini-bar, but I often grab a bottle of water or perhaps a sode. On the very nice wet-bar area counter was a price list. However, when I opened the refrigerator it was empty. It remained empty for my entire stay, but the price list, wine opener, ect. remained. No big deal as I saved my Company some money, but again an odd miss. The Reception was very good that I hosted in a space overlooking the lobby. I received very good comments from my Guests. Mike the Catering Manager was very pleasant to deal with, made great recomendations, and the Servers at the reception were very attentive to my Guests. I have no issues here. In summation I have no reason to not recommend as the location, ambiance, room size / decor were all very good. It is however those details that make a \"typical\" business hotel such as a Holiday Inn or a Hampton Inn (not picking on either, that make them what they are in their class. This is an Autograph Collection Hotel that to me is not yet at that level. If you can get a great rate, then I would stay here again. I guess I was disappointed that this could be a great hotel and has the potential, but just misses in so many of the needed details.", "author": {"username": "ScottFL", "num_cities": 3, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "num_reviews": 5, "location": "Orlando, Florida", "id": "ABCB9D57E95E5AF60177BB1C47362045"}, "date_stayed": "May 2012", "offering_id": 283873, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "June 2, 2012", "id": 131149658, "via_mobile": false}

I loved this hotel! It used to be a bank building, and you can tell from the old vault at the front desk and the huge open lobby area. This is a very historic area of downtown, and it was fun just to walk around and look at the architecture of the surrounding buildings too.\nThe lobby was beautiful, and I really liked the music they played in the common areas. Front desk staff weren't overly friendly, but got the job done very quickly, which was nice. Then we moved on to the elevators. They still have the old \"dial\" style things to show you which floor the elevator is on :-) You have to put your room key in a slot on the elevator before you can select your floor, which I thought was a nice security precaution, given some of the unsavory folks who sometimes live on the downtown streets here.\nWhen we arrived at our room on the third floor, we were blown away! One of the nicest rooms I've had in any hotel, anywhere. Seriously. It was a junior suite corner room, and it was huge. The bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom, too. It had an enormous shower, double sinks, and a jacuzzi tub big enough for two people. When night fell, we could see all the lights from the downtown buildings through our windows - what a cool ambience!\nThe bed and furniture were all quite comfy, and the room temperature was easy to control. Bedding was also top-notch, for an excellent night's sleep.\nIf the Mezzanine level is open in the lobby, there's a little romantic niche up there if you can find it\nWe had breakfast in the hotel restaurant, and it was very good and plentiful, and priced about like you'd expect in a hotel restaurant.\nIt was an excellent stay, and I'm already trying to figure out when we can come again!\nThe only negative: Mandatory valet for the car at $28 per night. I can understand this in a city like San Francisco or New Orleans, where cars must be parked very far from your hotel and valet has to go several blocks to retrieve your car; then it's a wonderful convenience to be able to valet your car instead of having to look for street parking. But this hotel has a parking garage attached to it, so I don't understand why we couldn't just park our own vehicle in it. Oh well.\nAdditional info: We ate at the Hearsay Gastro Lounge right around the corner, and the food was really good there.

The room was just brilliant. Whilst not the largest hotel room, it was perfectly sized for our needs and we found the view to be perfect and just what we wanted.\nAs it was our honeymoon, the Hotel staff had provided chocolate covered strawberries, chocolates, a bottle of wine and a nice congratulations letter. We thought this was a really nice gesture and started our trip off on a very positive note.\n Back to the room, The bed was super comfy and the bathroom was well laid out with a large amount of towels. The room doesn't come with a regular fridge as standard, it has a minibar style cooler which will charge you if you tamper with any of the contents however I believe a regular fridge can be provided if necessary. The rooms AC was a Godsend given how warm NY is this time of year. Walking back into the room after a scorching hot day was always a relief!\nEven if we had the do not disturb on the door, we would recieve a complimentary call in the evening asking if we would like our room cleaned later on anyway which is rare nowadays and a welcome choice.\nThe hotel staff, from front desk to the cleaners were all very polite and always eager to please. I would especially like to thank the three doormen we had most contact with; John, Carlos and Rocky. They opened doors, helped with our luggage and would hail cabs whenever we left on a day trip. \nThe only negative I could mention was the hotel only having one elevator. It's a minor complaint but staying on the 11th floor often meant we were waiting a little while on an elevator that wasn't packed full. As I said, a minor fault for a beautiful, comfortable and highly recommended hotel which we will DEFINITELY be staying at next time we travel to the Big Apple!

We finally chose the Setai for our 3 night, child-free stay in the City because it seemed to exude luxury - something you don't often get when 2 small children are in tow. We weren't disappointed. This is a classy hotel in a central location.\nWe stayed in a large terrace suite which had a queen bed, a seating area, a dressing area, an enormous bathroom with walk-in shower and the biggest bath you are ever likely to see. While you couldn't really see much from the terrace itself, it was a bonus to be able to lay out in the 'fresh' air and listen to the noise of NYC below. Nice touches generally in the room, include: a television in the bathroom mirror (things you never knew you needed), a free soft drinks mini bar, a nespresso machine and lovely biscuits/popcorn at turn-down. \nAs you would expect in a 5* hotel, the staff were all courteous, friendly and helpful, with some great insights for places to eat from the concierge. The spa was fabulous - we really didn't have enough time to do all the different treatment rooms justice but I can thoroughly recommend a massage. The bar was good. \nPerhaps my husband's favourite benefit of the hotel was the Maserati which gave us a ride to our dinner date. You can't book it but if you speak to the doorman on your way out in the evening, he can advise you if you're likely to be able to use the car and the waiting time.\nNone of the main sights are very far from the hotel; the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, the Chrysler Building, the Rockerfeller Plaza and the 5th avenue shops are all an easy walk. Real finds for us this time were the High Line, Bryant Park and Daniel restaurant.\nTo summarise, a great hotel if you want class, service and a little bit of luxury.

We were in town for a ballgame at Minute Maid Park, which was about a ten-minute walk from the hotel. The Icon is also located next to a stop on Houston's new light rail line and is close to downtown freeways. Do note that if you're staying here on the weekend that downtown Houston isn't yet a 24/7 hub of activity despite efforts to develop one. Finding coffee both Saturday and Sunday mornings was a challenge. However, drinking and dining options within a short drive were plentiful, and we found some good pubs and bars south along Main Street that satisfied our needs.\nThe room I stayed in had two queen beds, and ample seating. The desk doubled as the nightstand between the two beds, which was unique but fine. There was also ample storage in a closet and three-drawer dresser. The bathroom is huge and amply lit, and had a spacious shower/ tub with good water pressure. There was also a spacious marble counter in the bathroom and multiple large mirrors in the room and bath, which would be handy for primping if I did that!\nOne thing of note: the hotel is going for a retro 1920s-1930s look while positioning itself as a 21st Century hotel with modern amenities. The color schemes and furnishings are different from anything I've ever seen in a modern hotel. However, I think it mostly succeeds in its modern and classic stylings despite a few very minor hiccups (the free in-hotel wi-fi didn't seem to work).\nWe didn't avail ourselves of many of the hotel's amenities except the valet parking, which was prompt and reliable, if not a touch on the pricey side.

The nicest guy at the front desk, Robbie, probably saw the fear on my face and assured me not to worry that there was still some availability at the hotel.

There for since we were busy with other matters, we did everything we planned on our checkout day and were very satisfied to not have missed on anything we planed.\n-Non alcoholic drinks in fridge plenty. And what a marvelous idea was to suggest us if we only drink water then they will replenish it only with water, if you need more they will deliver, but we always had enough.\n-N espresso is great in the room, I have one home and addicted to it, so if you finish all of the coffee offered, call in the evening and they will deliver you more to have in the morning.\n-Quiet rooms so if you meditate, its great/or want to take siesta or fall asleep early, notify front desk not to be disturbed if your sign is on. The only time someone will knock are the fridge/coffee replenish or bring you cookies and will do turn down service if you desire.\n-For a suite the accommodation was huge and when the person knocked to deliver ice I was in the bathroom and it was a walk to get to the door, after I opened the door he thought no one was in and was about to leave, I thought that was funny explaining to him that it was a long walk to the door.\n-The rooms are well appointed and the decor is pleasant to the eyes. Room and Hotel itself is very clean.\n-If you are like me staying in 5 stars hotels the bathroom are pretty much the same in renovated hotels, ours was huge and I loved the window in the bathroom, we've been partying often in there while waiting for my service dog to finish his dinner, he is spoiled and wants us to be around when he its. \n-Two TVs are standard in NYC for suits. And if you never sow TV in the mirror, I somehow felt the screen was bigger than in other hotels.\n-Bed is comfortable, so are pillows, I absolutely adored the style of the windows, honestly that was my first choice to stay in Setai, provides with ability to look down without stretching.\nyour neck. And lower window opens from the top which is less scarier than from the bottom as in Trump Soho.\n-If after your room was cleaned and you noticed that something wasn't replenished - a phone call away and a minute of wait.\n-If your top cover not on the bed with little neck pillow, it is most likely in the closet.\n-Loved the Foyer, Powder room with the door.\n-Real walk in room closet.\n-Bath tub is for two and the biggest I was in aside from that in Mercer.\n-Rain Shower.\n-the hotel has Souna and Steam room, Gym, with private room for floor exercise alone or with personal trainer. \n-If you take advantage of their spa, you also receive access to whirl pool, ha-mam, and rain shower from all over top, walls (this kind of shower was my first time experience to see) and plenty of healthy snack and fruits and drinks. The spa person will be more than happy to give you the tour. We did the tour of the hotel while waiting for our room cleaned.\n-We didn't use the bar or restaurant, because my husband already planned the places to eat ahead of arrival and it is his department. If you are like us who enjoy rather unquiet ambiance the kind that no one can hear your conversation we liked Dallas and Irish Pub a block away. We drink protein shakes for breakfast and lunch, but the day of our check out we walked over to Barking Dog which is famous for their Pancakes which I like and my husband ordered eggs and mixed breakfast meats.plate. Don't order toast, it comes with the good size bun.\n-Places to see Bryant Park, always something going on there, there is a watering whole and instead of benches there are chairs and tables. Which are scattered all over and you can find private spot to enjoy and then move to another spot that is what we were doing. I also think the chairs for the reason that a person don't make a bed out of it. Park is opened until 9PM. Security is present. Oh and they also have ping pong table there to rent.\n-Library a must see, I've been there many times when I was studying in University. But being there as a tourist is not the same experience, things I missed. They always have something in the exhibition room that is unique theme. \n-AC is quiet and works perfect with 3 room temperature thermostats.\n-Not like I ever seen in other hotels the channels managary is organized in sections, where each section of channels is listed in TV guide with consecutive numbers. I don't recall seeing such in other hotels.\nCons: non I can think of. If you are experienced traveler you know what to do, if you are not, don't upset yourself with something that wasn't done the way you expected, just ask they are there to ensure you leave Setai Happy. \n-Suites are expensive, but once you try one you cannot go below, but in my opinion there is nothing like staying in the suit. But if you are in New York Sight Seeing and believe me you will be disappointing not booking longer stay, but even if it is longer stay you still will not have enough days to see all. We've been coming to NYC on vacation 12 times and still didn't see everything we wanted to see. But since we are local we mostly come to enjoy the room and the view is the top priority for me.\n-I wish we could have stayed on the higher floor that would really complete our joy.\nFrom my experience if you come with the right attitude you will do your self and your health a lot of good and will only bring good memories back. This worked in every hotel in NYC we stayed at, except Soho Trump with the staff there Guaranteed to ruin not just your stay but entire vacation, and you will stay 5 categories below of the room you reserved in SohoTrum for the price double of what you pay in Setai.", "author": {"username": "et49589", "num_cities": 7, "num_helpful_votes": 30, "num_reviews": 27, "num_type_reviews": 15, "id": "1D4375564ACBF09100851CA78649BFD9", "location": "New York City"}, "date_stayed": "July 2012", "offering_id": 1776857, "num_helpful_votes": 5, "date": "July 25, 2012", "id": 135384089, "via_mobile": false}

The room was very nice and as others have stated, the bath was spacious well appointed. \nAfter arrival we hit the bar for cocktails and we have to say, this was the highlight of our trip. Our barman , Houston Farris, is probably the best I've come across. This guy is an expert in classic cocktails, and it was a pleasure just watching him create outstanding drinks, one after another. I am really into classic drinks and the cocktail menu in this bar is real gem. Nothing run of the mill about it. I started with a martini, and it was one of the best I've ever had, with a splash of orange bitters and garnished with a lemon twist. I also sampled the Aviation, and the Manhattan no.5. My wife had a great margarita and was treated to the recipe. \nWe ended eating at the bar and tried three appetizers, first was a pork torta,then a seafood cocktail, and finally shrimp and grits. Each was outstanding. We talked for days about how good the food and drinks were that night.\nWe enjoyed the hotel, the service, the food and drink so much we seriously discussed changing our travel plans to allow another night's stay.", "author": {"username": "sodajones", "num_cities": 3, "num_helpful_votes": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "location": "Overland Park, KS", "id": "5B2EAD15A161ABEF04EC1DAE092F3B68"}, "date_stayed": "April 2012", "offering_id": 283873, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "April 18, 2012", "id": 128109461, "via_mobile": true}

The machines are all fairly new with a good variety so that everyone could use what they want. The morning I went to do a workout I didn't have to wait for a single machine. They provide Gatorade by the cup, bottled water, tea and coffee at the break station. Each machine has towels and earphones provided. Good weight and weightlifting machine selection. Lots of bosu balls and a nice stretching section.\nI tried the restaurant for a couple breakfasts and had room service a couple of times at night.

And even though it is a cool landing spot, with clean lines and a techno music vibe, we do feel quite at home each and every time we visit. By now, after perhaps 10 or so visits to this hotel, we have had the opportunity to stay in a variety of rooms - all seem just a bit different, many with stunning views and those without the city views are often suites - a bonus if space is your thing. Without exception, the rooms are quiet and extraordinarily clean. We love that somehow the professionals who man (and woman) the front desk and lobby remember our tiny four legged pooch each time we visit. It is likely because he is a wild little guy, but we like to think the top notch Patrick, who often checks us in and Gabriella, who problem solves just about anything, just have outstanding memories! Do take in their happy hour on the 2nd floor, but be sure to wander up to the 5th floor terrace, even in brisk weather to catch a glimpse of 6th Avenue facing downtown at dusk - just lovely. The hotel is in a section of town that is getting better and coming back. Restaurants and shopping (the famed Macy's is just three blocks north) are often just a few blocks away - and if you're a walker, you are in a perfect location to take in mid-town, Chelsea and even mid-town east shops and dining. We love the location because it is a block from Penn Station and on a straight thoroughfare uptown or downtown. The hotel has kept its standards high since our first stay the week they opened. It sounds like they are working on getting the bar/cocktail lounge up and running - so we'll look forward to that on a future visit. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a hip, central, welcoming stay and deals can often be found if you book well-enough in advance.

This hotel is the most beautiful in the city architecturally, and I finally got the chance to stay there early this year. Nearly everything is worthy of the legend; the lobby is exclusive and quiet, though welcoming, and is beautifully appointed. \nThe elevators have hand-painted details with medieval style art showing animals and flowers among the carved wood and coffered ceilings. The hallways are a bit to Plaza-ish for my taste, a bit too frou-frou but not as garish as the Plaza (as if something could be). Our Park View Suite was on a high floor at the corner; one side had a perfectly-framed view of the Empire State Building, while the majority of the windows looked out onto the park where we could see up to about 96th street on CPW. The bellman said that our room was John Travolta's favorite place to stay in New York (I immediately heard my own lying voice telling fares in the Taxi years ago that Mick Jagger had just got out of the cab, which usually made for a good story and a good tip). \nThe room was gigantic by NYC hotel room comparison, and the fantasy-inspiring park view held our attention for quite a while before it slowly sank in that the room must have been decorated by the art director from Saturday Night Fever, and no wonder Travolta likes it. I would be surprised to see calculations showing that less than 35% of the walled surface was covered by mirrors, and the mirrors seemed to live in the bathroom where they covered every single inch of everything except the floor (marble), commode, counter, basin and ceiling. Utter reflectivity, and images of one's self cascading to infinity. Even the back of the bathroom door was completely covered in mirrors, in case you wanted to close it and shoot a sequel to \"Enter the Dragon\" there. \nLarge brown sectional sofa with tan and brown pillows (I remember the '70s term - \"earth tones\"), sharply contrasting with a clean Biedermeier-style entertainment center and a large round glass dining table far, far too big for that part of the room. That's it for complaints, any my dwelling on them reflects $900 a night in different expectations. When I asked for a different room, something less-reflective, they said all the Park View suites were booked (and explained that each unit is actually a privately- owned condo, decorated by the owners).... But still, each staff person was helpful, friendly and unobtrusive. The nightly Godiva chocolates and daily flowers were cheerful. The room service from Cipriani's should be a model for everyone to follow. The bedroom had a walk-in closet where the kids delighted in hiding. The small kitchenette had a full-size fridge which we stocked with items from Katz's and Zabar's and Balducci's. We had a terrific time- with the views, the service, proximity to the park and Wollman Rink, the immense room space, and the happiness we got just from looking at the structure.

From the minute we arrived we were treated like old friends. The front desk (Evelyn & Gabriel) were helpful and tried their best to get an early check in into our suite beacuse we arrived at about 9 a.m., but nothing was availble. While we waited, the front desk staff entertained our kids with magic tricks! When they did get us in (still a few hours earlier than official check in time) they gave us a beautiful suite on the 16th floor (quiet, spacious, good air conditioner-we were there during a heat wave). . The bell staff (Bobby, Johan and Matthew) were friendly and knowledgable, and gave us good suggestions for families since we were tourists traveling with a 10- & 11-year-old. During our stay there were thunderstorms and the hotel had \"loaner\" umbrellas near the door for our use as we cruised around the city, which was great.\nI've read complaints from others about the conteniental breakfast, but we thought it was plenty of food and choices. Since it was included in the room price for the four of us, it was a terrific value (you can't beat free). The breakfast consisted of rolls, assorted pastries, bagels, (the little chocolate croissants were especially yummy), tea, coffee, hot chocolate, milk, orange juice, assorted yogurts, cottage cheese, whole apples, assorted jams, cream cheese, Rice Krispies and Corn Flakes. The nice lady working at the breakfast kept everything well stocked throughout the morning (7-10 a.m.)\nOur suite was clean and well appointed and roomy (we couln't believe we had that much space in mid-town Manhattan). The housekeeping staff was wonderful too. They were available the minute we requested anything. Returning from our daily adventures, the place was always spotless and my dirty dishes were the all done. What a luxury! The kitchenette came with a microwave, refridgerator, sink, dishes/service for 4 +. \nThe Hotel location is also wonderful. It's walking distance to many attractions and a variety of restaurants (although there is a subway station not too far away). The front door staff is on top of it when you need a cab hailed (although much of the time we just tried to walk off the great Italian food we'd eaten in the neighborhood).\nThe staff of the hotel went well above our expectations.

If you are here for a convention there is not a better option.\nIf you are just in Houston and not worried about the convention center then you might elect to go elsewhere. Again - this is a convention hotel. So - if you aren't attending a convention - do you really want to stay in a hotel with thousands of people who are??? It's a big property. There are east elevators and west elevators. There are 2 big circular entrances with valet parking. Lots of lounge space etc.\nI found the rooms to be nice - and quiet. The elevators were fast. The executive lounge was nice. The food was good.\nThe internet was pitiful. I was on the 14th floor - a high floor - but not the top floor. There are I think 6 or 7 floors above 14. I couldn't get a wireless signal better than low signal and frequently it just dropped altogether. It amazes me that Hilton charges for the internet - and then on top of that the service is so poor it wouldn't be worth the money if it was free.\nThe valet parking is the only easy option. There is a self park garage ($15 instead of $30) - good luck. The valet service is not fast. You will not have to worry about whether you forgot to pay for your valet service - because you will not see your car until you have paid. The guys themselves are fine - and very comfortable receiving tips.\nThe front desk is where I found service most lacking. at check-in it seemed that they hired high school kids who were busy playing around. Not a big deal - but not what I would expect. At check-out it was ridiculous. There were 4 clerks. One was working with a customer using a highlighter on a map (why the concierge or bell desk wasn't doing that is a mystery). One was standing there but \"unable to help you.\" I gave him my room keys - he said he could take them but could not check me out - then stood back. He seemed angry. I'm guessing that he was in trouble for something and was waiting for a manager to let him access his computer again. It was interesting to see a grown man pout. The other two were on the phone making what sounded like personal calls. The thing is they didn't get off the phone. A line of about 6 people formed. This was at 11:45 am - checkout time is noon. How in the world does a hotel not have a manager on the floor to see this fiasco at what should be a very busy time. In the end - I saw the other folks wanting to check out just write their room numbers on a papaer and put them on the clerk's keypad (while she glared at the interrpution to her call). \nIt was bizarre. I assume that some confrontation had just occurred - someone fired or dressed down etc - and that the manager had just walked away. It looked like the entire desk staff were engaged in telling their friends and coworkers how terribel life was and what victims they were.\nIn any case the bottom line doesn't change - if you are going to the convention center stay here - there is no better choice.

Somehow mixing ultra-modern features with luxury art deco style (high tech room controls on the phone), bathroom in sparkly maroon/brown granite and mirrors, TV in the wall, and the toilet from space with a warm seat and water jets (!!!). The upgraded room had a small \"walk in\" closet with safe and mini bar area, seating area, and desk that opened up to reveal a light and work area.\nThe location can't be beat for Times Square activity, without being right on the square (just half a block off).\nMaybe the only downsides were that the room control touch screen on the phone did not respond well to touch, so it was often hard to change the lighting and drapery settings; also that the desk lamp that lights up when the lid is hinged open basically shined directly at eye level while working, so I had to drape a hand towel to serve as a visor when working on my laptop.\nBut overall, this was an amazing luxury boutique hotel, at a great location, with incredible service.

The food was good and a la cate only, we enjoyed the tranquility of the restaurant which is a far cry from the hustle n bustle of the typical buffet breakfast. The staffs were all very friendly and warm, which I felt was much more welcoming than the rigid politeness of some of the old style hotels on the upper east side. Location is obviously very good, within walking distance of multiple subway stations which I must say (the NYC subway) has been further improved since I was there a few years ago. Bath room fixture is top notch and the warm air coming out from under the sink, warming your feet n the marble floor is particularly thoughtful.

I love the interior of the hotel and the decor, very pretty. Check in was fast and the desk attendant was very polite. The room was very roomy with modern decor. We decided to walk around the City Center area for a bit that afternoon...I guess I didn't realize how new the whole area is, but there are still very few retail stores occupying the spaces, however there are several restraunts, and there is still construction going on around the area. We decided to have a cupcake at Sweet and then a drink at Yard House. Later in the evening we walked over to Brio for dinner. The general area around the hotel outside was just swarming with people...and was still equally packed when we came back over 2 hours later after dinner...lots of kids running around too which I thought was strange since it was after 10pm and it doesn't strike me as a kid or family oriented area. After dinner we decided to go up the the hotel bar, the Monnalisa, for drinks and some live music. The music and drinks were great...but unfortunately we didn't stay too long because it was absolutely packed in there and there was no seating available by the time we got there...very little offered to begin with. We would have been ok to stand for a while and enjoy the music, but for some reason there is a large fire pit in the center of the room. While it looks really cool, it's still fire and it really heated the place up! That heat combined with the muggy and hot Houston air flowing in and out as people walked out onto the patio just made it uncomfortable in there. Next time I'll make sure we get there early so we can get a table...far away from the fire! We weren't ready to turn in for the night so decided to go over to the large lounge area near the lobby...there was ample seating there inside as well as outside and only a few people over there. We ended up sitting for a while on the patio (2nd floor) and people watched below. When we returned to our room we found a bottle of champagne waiting for us on ice! Neither one of us ordered it and there wasn't a note (and we weren't charged for it) so I'm assuming it was just a gift from the hotel...Nice :) I do have to say that the walls are paper thin. I was unfortunately kept up several hours throughout the night because of some drunken fools banging and screaming. From what I could hear, I believe they were asked to keep it down several times either by hotel staff or other guests, but that seemed to only fuel their behavior. So, while the bad behavior of others certainly isn't the hotel's fault, the walls provided VERY little noise buffer! I booked the room package that included sunday brunch at the hotel restaurant, Bistro Alex. The food and service here are great. I highly recommend this package for the value. The brunch included in the package is not buffet, but on a normal menu and you can just order to your content as many courses as you like...even dessert! One adult beverage per person is included too. I recommend the steak migas...soooo good! There were also musicians playing jazz music throughout brunch with was great! Also, we did not use the pool, but walked by it several times and were surprised at how super-tiny it is! the lounges by the pool look really nice, but I was just really surprised at how small the area is as well as the pool itself. If you are planning on some pool time during your stay, I'd get down there early to claim a spot!

I remember seeing it when I was a little kid, so I wasn't expecting a 5-Star quality resort. I had middle of the road expectations, and when I got to the property, at first, my expectations were met. \nI was originally placed on the 9th floor (known as the quiet floor... I have no idea what that means).. but priority rewards member.. free upgrade to club level. Aw, the club floor perks dont run on Friday. Oh well. \nWas in room 200. It's a nice, large room. The bed was very firm and comfortable, the linens fresh and clean. \nThis particular room had been upgraded to a more modern television, but I soon learned this made no difference because the signal to the television was analog, so it took a 4:3 image and just stretched it to 16:9, all in glorious 480i resolution. There was an HBO guide in my room, but I couldn't find HBO on my TV, and unlike ANY other hotel I've stayed in, there was no TV Channel guide in the room. I was on my own blindly looking for channels. \nThe internet is slow as you can see by my screenshot. I'd guess they have just one 1.5mbps T1 based on the bandwidth I was seeing. They really need to upgrade their circuit. \nThere were some minor cleanliness issues with the room (see photos). There was black mold growing on the caulking in the tub. That was kinda gross. \nI ordered room service. They forgot the bacon on my hickory burger. I was hungry and just ate it anyway because I didn't want to wait any longer. Sadly, after I ate the burger I learned from click2houston.com that the crown plaza has had an amazing 33 health code violations from the city of houston health department for 2012 so far. Eeek. That's the 5th worst report in the entire city according to their list. Really, you can go there and read all the violations. \nThe staff at the hotel, is amazingly friendly and helpful. They really make the property.\nYou absolutely want to stay in the tower, and not the \"courtyard rooms\". The courtyard rooms look like it'd be like staying in a motel, with the rooms opening up to the exterior instead of the interior hallways. \nMy room had a fairly nice Timex alarm clock with AUX input (for mp3 player) and had built in wave/rain/white noise sounds you could listen to. \nThere was a giant spider living above room 218. (See pic). \nBut the thing that made my visit the absolute worst visit of any visit to any hotel ever: when I first got to the hotel, it was very quiet. But then suddenly, a ton of people show up for an event in the ballroom, based on what I saw, I assume it was a Quincea\u00f1era. And they had a DJ. And the event went on. And on. And on. And you could hear it pretty much all over the hotel. And there were people out in the pool and hottub even after it was supposed to have been closed. And they were making noise. Front desk called security, but he apparently did nothing. They were in the pool for at least an hour after that. At nearly 1:00AM I can STILL hear the music blaring from the event. I go to the front desk, and they offer to move me to room 910. I go up to 910, and there are ants crawling around everywhere. I go back to the front desk, and they offer to move me another, but smaller room on the 9th floor. Whatever... its late, and I'm tired. I go back down to the 2nd floor to get my stuff, and its now 1:45AM. Thankfully, the music has stopped. I tell the front desk I'm just going to stay in 200, put the do not disturb on the door, and finally go to sleep.

I would definately have ordered more had there not been so many amazing places to eat close by.

When vacationing I typically have a higher tolerance for poor service, less quality food, and the like. So I will not stay again at this hotel.

Excellent offering and a life saver given the seedy character and deserted streets in Downtown (at least when it is after 6 pm.) Rooms are large and the bathroom is fabulous and even larger. Love the tub and shower. Quality ammentities. TV is large and has High definition channels. Maintenance was responsive and professional\nDislikes: Food at restaurant : Unhealthy, over priced, Incredible slow service, servers and bar personnel are more interested in talking with each other than servicing the guests Took 25 min for soup and salad at 9:30 pm. Soup was luke warm --I guess the microwave was not working since it would not pass a kitchen inspection if served this temp. Likely kept in the fridge and microwaved to heat up. If on a diet this is not the place to eat...except for salads Ordered a cucumber and tomatoe salad. Not exagerating 20 min to recieve and Approx 1/4 of a tomato, 1/8 of a cucumber, 3 bits of feta cheese , 1 slice of onion, a couple bits of shredded mint and maybe 20 pepitas . and I added 2 shrimp This very very small salad cost 13 $. 1/2 cup of soup was $7.

A previous reviewer had commented that there was all new furniture, but if this is true, I couldn't tell. \nI stayed in a room with two double beds and it was incredibly cramped. The room had a huge over-sized recliner that I could have done without, since it left nowhere to store my suitcase. Luckily I was traveling for work and I only needed one bed, so I had my suitcase on the bed I wasn't sleeping in. The rooms do have mini-fridges and microwaves, so that's a plus. \nThe bathroom is an okay size, and they have the sink and vanity area separate from the toilet and bathtub, which is nice if you are traveling with multiple people. The complimentary toiletries leave something to be desired - they give you shampoo but no conditioner. \nThe free breakfast was adequate, but the breakfast area is fairly small, so it was difficult to maneuver around at the same time as multiple other guests. There are also very few tables in the dining area, and the tables a very close together, so you have to be careful not to bump into them. A larger person would definitely have trouble getting around the tables. \nThe free manager's reception in the evening is nice, although you are limited to three drinks, and the snacks consist of goldfish, pretzels, tortilla chips, salsa and processed cheese.\nThe pool is actually kind of nice - it's not huge, but it is partially indoors and partially outdoors, so you have a choice of swimming with or without sun.\nAll in all, it is an okay hotel.

When we first arrived all seemed well, we were told our room would have a \"poolside\" view. Upon entering the room we noticed it was a bit warm but attributed it to the fact that most hotels turn down the thermostat when unoccupied. I went to turn it to \"cooler\" but the knob (yeah, I know right...) just spun and spun. I had to pull the knob off, replace it with a knob off of another control, then turn it to \"cooler\". While I was doing this my girlfriend was in the bathroom hustling to get ready for the workshop, and came out to tell me that their was hair in the tub! That tells me the housekeepers need a refresher course because in addition to hair in the tub, there was crumbs all over the floor. The ceiling in the main living area had black gunk all around the edges, looked like mildew, didn't want to know. The poolside view? Was of decaying palm trees, you couldn't see anything from the patio. The amenities advertised on the web site were non-existent, no microwave or mini-fridge. The tv was a 21\" old school tube type that I haven't seen in years ANYWHERE! Being good sports since we already had unpacked and got the room at a great rate and trying to make the best of things, we stuck it out.....until the next day. I finally had to go complain at the front desk about the air conditioner not working, (it ran all day and all night and the room stayed temperate at best). We ended up having to move to the inside of the hotel, the tower, to floor #9. Immeadiately upon entering this room we could see that there is obviously a profiled system of room assignments. The majority of the guests for the Kizomba workshop are/were Latino or Black and were given rooms on the \"outside\" with the view of the pool probably at a discounted rate. Everyone of them we spoke to had the same complaints about the air conditioner, lack of amenities, type of tv, etc. The new room we were assigned had a 32\" Samsung flat screen and the air conditioner was cold. This room was cleaner, had nicer linen and bed coverings, the bathroom was clean, etc. The best thing about this hotel was the pool which is spacious enough, clean, and not to deep. While at the pool I noticed the whirlpool wasn't working....imagine my suprise. I have to commend Crystal, she was working the front desk and handled my complaint with grace, quickness, and genuine concern. She arranged for staff to bring a luggage dolly to our room, pack our things, and deliver them to the new room while we had the complimentary breakfast buffet ($12 value per person x 3). She called later to say that the horrible hot night we spent there would be comped as well. I appreciate her service very much. I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy or a homeless person even if it was free. There are other hotels in this area that I would suggest you look into before this place.

Not having any friends or family in the area to stay with, I used priceline.com to find a hotel that I could stay at for cheap. I was able to stay at the Crowne Plaza for an amazing $40 per night for 18 nights. It was the best home away from home I could have asked for. \nThe most impressive feature of this hotel by far was the clientele. I probably spoke with every person who worked behind the front desk and they were all SUPER friendly and helpful. I have to give a shout-out to Henry, who checked me in with a warm welcome and a free membership into the Priority Club, which allowed me free breakfast every morning, and free drinks and finger foods in the evening. \nSpeaking of the Priority Club food\u2014it was delightful. Every morning they had pastries, fresh fruit, good coffee, assorted yogurts, cereal, juice, milk, bagels, English muffins, and bread for toast. The finger foods in the evening were surprisingly satisfying\u2014always one hot item like onion rings, spring rolls, chicken wraps, or meatballs, plus really good cheese and crackers, fresh fruit, and fresh vegetables with ranch dressing. And the free drinks included all kinds of beer, wine, and cocktails. (P.S. When I ran out of free drink tickets, I went to the front desk and asked for more and the lady working was happy to oblige. I was afraid I\u2019d be overstepping but she was very kind to give me enough to last until the end of my stay!)\nAnother favorite feature of mine was the pet-friendly policy. Since I was going to be gone from home for 3 weeks, I needed to be able to bring my cat along, and was able to at the Crowne Plaza for a small one-time fee of $25 (which was a steal considering that wouldn\u2019t buy me 2 nights at a kennel). And since I had my cat in my room during the day while I was at class, they let me leave the do-not-disturb sign on the door during the day until I told them I was back in the evening so that they could send the maid and I could put my cat in his carrier while she made up the room. It was the perfect arrangement and accommodation for my needs. \nA couple other great amenities I enjoyed at this hotel were the business center (where I was able to print things for class for free), the fitness room (which had a cold water dispenser, cups, towels, a big wall of mirrors, 3 treadmills, an elliptical machine, a stationary bike, free weights, and a couple weight machines), a nice outdoor pool and hot tub, and a small convenience item room where I bought some emergency contact solution and candy bars \uf04a. \nAnd of course my room was great\u2014I especially loved the floor-to-ceiling wall-to-wall windows, as did my cat \uf04a. I was on the 7th floor and I never heard any noise from neighbors next to, above, or below me. And the king-size bed was really comfortable. \nThe biggest surprise came to me on my last night in the hotel\u2014I would be leaving the next day but the problem was that I had class until 4, and needed to leave my cat somewhere before heading out of town afterward. I asked the front desk for an extended check-out so that I could leave my cat in the room while I was in class and pick him up on my way out around 4:30. Even though their policy says otherwise, the manager gave me a break, and let me take my time and check out as soon as was convenient. This made my last few days in Houston so much easier and stress-free. \nI am truly grateful for the hospitality of the Crowne Plaza in Brookhollow\u2014it is a one-of-a-kind hotel and I hope I have a reason to return to Houston in the future so that I may stay here again!", "author": {"username": "Jessi M", "num_reviews": 2, "id": "398B83D3763A54F022D0CE79E543D8E3", "location": "Lubbock, Texas, United States"}, "date_stayed": "June 2012", "offering_id": 99081, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "June 27, 2012", "id": 132924300, "via_mobile": false}

The furnishings and interior decorations were beautiful. Usually, if I am unsure of a location I purchase my own set of bedding once I arrive in the city to ensure that I am comfortable. At this location, there was no need to bother. I was quite comfortable with the sheets and comforter that were on the bed - they appeared brand new. \nWhat was surprising to me was the level of customer service I received from such an establishment. Although the price we paid was not on the level of the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton, the level of service we received was comparable to those 5* hotels. Front desk employees always addressed us by name and were just as helpful, if not more, than any other 5* concierge I have dealt with. \nThe hotel provided a very adequate continental breakfast each morning and although I did not partake, others in my party were quite satisfied. \nOverall, I would most highly recommend this location.

Our default hotels are usually the Four Seasons and the Mandarin Oriental and despite the high rating on TA I was unsure about an unknown hotel. I shouldn't have worried. \nThe hotel is excellent. The guy at check-in was a delight, really charming, personable and efficient, reflective of all the staff we encountered during our 8 night stay. We'd booked a studio suite (which doesn't come with kitchen) and I was prepared to ask to a room with a view over 5th Ave, but as it happens our allocated room came with the view. Our room (1004) was huge, with a large dressing area and a large bathroom. It was all quite high spec, with a large TV, Nespresso machine, ipod dock and a bathroom TV. The bed was large and very comfortable. As many have pointed out, the soft-drink mini bar is free as, is the wi-fi, both count very highly with me! Also some of the best hotel slippers I have encountered. As others have pointed out, the rooms are rather beige - an accent of burgundy, I feel, would not go amiss in any future design updates. But no matter.\nThe staff I thought was excellent - all very personable without being too in-your-face. The concierge offered good recommendations for eating out and for the cinema. The hotel car was often in use, but we usually preferred to walk so we didn't enqire of its availability very often. We had a couple of massages at the Spa, which were very good and typically priced for New York.\nWe only have a couple of criticisms. Firstly, our requests made to the personal assistants, whether by phone or in person, were often not responded to. When we told that a blu-ray player or a pillow or housekeeping would be sent to our room, it usually wasn't. Most of our requests required repeat calls before our they were fulfilled - the management needs to address this, because this lack of service is not in keeping with the high standards evident in the rest of the hotel. Secondly, breakfast was a tad pricey for my liking. Our light breakfast (me: bagel, him: eggs benedict, plus coffee and orange juice) came to, I think, $110 all in. While I have money to spend, I don't like to waste it. Thirdly, not enough hangers for two people. Small points, but one likes to give a full picture.\nIf I were to come back for a long weekend and hadn't been to New York before I would probably stay somewhere closer to Central Park, but otherwise I would come back to the Setai time and again. It seemed excellent value to me, when compared with the Mando and Four Seasons.

After pouring over online reviews, I chose Eventi for its rooms but mainly for the stellar service. The rooms were wonderful and a good size for NY standards. I loved the spacious marble bathroom with walk in shower and rain shower head. The decor was modern and perfect for our taste. I requested extra towels from housekeeping and the request was met the next day with a nice note to boot. The property itself is great. Even the location, which we were skeptical about, was good. Granted most of the reviewers are accurate in that there's not much in terms of dining options immediately outside the hotel, but you can take the subway or cab nearly anywhere and Penn Station is only a short walk from the hotel. \nNow let's talk about service, and I'm referring specifically to the front desk and concierge. I had read again and again on this site about how the staff went above and beyond for them. Unfortunately, we experienced none of it. Even as Kimpton In Touch members, the most we received was the mini bar credit and free in-room WiFi. Upgrade to rooms upon check-in? Nope. Great view of the Empire State? Not unless you consider walking over to a side window and looking left a \"great view\". We needed directions to MetLife Stadium for a college football game and wasted a lot of time, behind other frustrated patrons, waiting for the concierge, who was nowhere to be found during our entire stay. The bell captain finally came over and printed something out for us, which was basically straight off of the stadium website (and information we already had). \nWhen it came time for restaurant reservations, the staff seemed to know of only one place: The Breslin. What's a good breakfast place around here? The Breslin. Where should we go for drinks? The Breslin. Is there a special dessert place we should try? The Breslin. Seriously? With the number of incredible restaurants in the city, that's all you've got for me? We actually tried it the first morning for breakfast but again spent an inordinate amount of time looking for it. We were given the 2 cross streets but no other information. We realized pretty quickly how many storefronts there were on that corner and ultimately discovered that The Breslin is inside the Ace hotel! Needless to say, after a few tries with the staff, we ended up using our online resources to find our way around and to discover where to eat in the city. I did try one more time to secure dinner reservations at Spice Market, which incidentally the concierge at The Hyatt near Grand Central told us about. Front desk called us back to let us know only 11pm was available. I jumped online to the restaurant website and booked a 6:15pm via Open Table. I was even able to push it back to 8pm on the same day based on our own changing schedule. So it seems, the internet was more of value than the hotel staff. \nI was really excited at the thought of being treated like royalty based on the reviews, but sorry to say, we didn't feel the love Eventi!", "author": {"username": "blessed2have3", "num_reviews": 4, "id": "3358642A891EF45AD26574DADBF4AF31", "location": "San Ramon, California"}, "date_stayed": "September 2012", "offering_id": 1456560, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "September 13, 2012", "id": 140172348, "via_mobile": false}

The property is beautiful and located among the trees and a hill on Buffalo Bayou. We booked a Sunday Spa package with a deluxe room, a massage,late 4 pm check out and a credit in their dining room. We arrived on Saturday at noon and the 4th floor room was beautiful, the front desk very friendly and hospitable. The pool wasn't heated, we defaulted to a small indoor jacuzzi that was over run by children who had come to swim. The casual dining room wasn't open and we were directed to to the bar, the bartender said it wasn't 1pm and she couldn't serve us yet. We ended up in the high end restaurant for lunch. Sleeping was impossible, at 10:30pm a woman was scoulding a screaming child in the hall (I guess in an effort to not wake a sibling in the room). At midnight the area outside on the first floor patio had a couple smoking and talking loudly. At 1:30 am a loud drunk crowd bustled down the hall. Falling asleep again, about 3 am another drunk crowd came through and woke us up. We didn't call the front desk because we had no desire to change rooms at 3am. They were supposed to deliver coffee to the room at 8 am and did not. I called room service and they said they would send it, I called back they said the left it outside the room and knocked on the door. They had not. They finally got it to us by 9 am. The spa was beautiful!!! The next afternoon, we had booked a couples massage and it was a transcendental experience. The therapist were first class and gave us relaxing massages, offered us champagne, juice or tea and light snacks. We relaxed in their whirlpool and sauna. Leaving the spa, we were starved and moved to the casual restaurant. It was 2:30 and they told us they were closing. The reluctantly served us and attempted to charge our meal to the room. The waiter came back and told us we had been checked out (all of our belongings were in the room and we were locked out. We had to go to the front desk and inform them that we had a package with 4pm checkout. They gave us new room keys, charged the lunch to our room and told us we could\" take as much time as we needed to leave the room.\" I went to my room and decided to go and get a detailed bill of our charges. I took the stairs which exited outside the hotel. It had rained the concrete outside the door was slippery and I did the splits on the concrete. I filed all of my complaints at the front desk and they issued a $100 credit, which is not enough for all of the disappointment. My husband had called the valet for the car. The car arrived and they had not charged the parking to our room and we had closed out. My husband went inside to pay for the valet. The valets and bell men were all standing around talking while I sloughed my luggage into the trunk. After in the car, we saw the valet had left mud in the carpeting of our freshly cleaned car. I will say we were very disappointed. \n Summary, *the pool wasn't heated, *the restaurant wasn't open,* bartender was rude and wouldn't serve us food, *doors and windows thin (noise all night),*they didn't deliver the 8 am coffee that was scheduled, *they checked us out before our time ended resulting in extra trips to the front desk,* the concrete slippery,* the valets ignored me as I loaded our luggage, *they forgot to bill the parking (another trip to the front desk) and *they got mud on the carpet of our car.

AND AMAZING FOOD!!!\u201d", "text": "I stayed here for the international quilt festival. The host hotels were all booked, and I'm so glad because I got to stay here!!! I love the theme of the hotel. You have to love staying at a place with a story. This building used to be a bank a century ago. The vault behind the main desk and the luxurious lobby sets the tone as soon as you arrive. I stayed in a room with a jetted tub that was totally worth the extra money. I was staying by myself, but the niceness of the room makes it totally honeymoon worthy. Giant tub that you can see from the bed (or close the shutters if you want privacy) and giant glass shower...beautiful view of the city.\nI had an issue with figuring out how to work the tub the first night because there are two faucets...one that fills the tub quickly and a handheld one to rinse off with. I couldn't figure out how to switch between them, so I called the front desk to see if they knew. They sent someone to my room in literally a couple minutes. They must have a handyman on call because this guy showed up with a whole tool chest ready to go to work, but he showed me how to work the faucets and that tub was FABULOUS!!! I had another issue later in my stay (I was there five days) with the key to my room. It was demagnitized by the convention center (no fault to the hotel). The hotel elevators are secured by your room key...you have to use your room key to move between floors. So it wouldn't let me move the elevator. I was only on the elevator about 30 seconds and was getting ready to go to the front desk to get a new key when a manager stepped on the elevator and asked if I needed assistance. I told him what happened and he escorted me to my room, opened my door, and sent someone up with a key a couple minutes later!!! Needless to say, I was highly impressed with the customer service. \nThere are bulls and cows subtly strewn throughout the hotel decor. I loved this feature because my hubby and I have inside jokes about cows. If you don't like it, it is subtle... and it's Texas, so it fits whether you like it or not. \nI also workout regularly so I did use the fitness center a few times. It's actually underneath the hotel so you go through the spa to get there. There are free headphones for you to use, clean rolled towels, and all the essential equipment for your workout....really stylish red equipment and all the walls were brick and there was really nice overhead lighting.\nI also used the transportation service regularly to get back and forth from the convention center. You go to the valet area to ask for a ride and they give you a business card to call them to pick you up. They can get busy around the main rush hours, but I never waited longer than 15 minutes which is praiseworthy in my opinion for downtown Houston.\nFinally, I used the restaurant for several meals, both breakfast and dinner. I thought the food was FANTASTIC. Very original but not so out there that there's no way I'd touch it. They have a shrimp and crab meat salad there that is amazing, and my very first breakfast was a heaping plate of vanilla french toast topped with toasted nuts and powdered sugar and served with maple syrup on the side and a bowl of bananas...all for about $10...hungry? :) YUM!\nSo, I know some people on here complain about the wait for the free (I repeat, FREE) transportation (that goes all over downtown Houston if I forgot to mention that), the cow decor, and whatever else...maybe I'm too middle class to understand complaints like that, but my overall assessment--I think this place ROCKS!!!", "author": {"username": "Julzmyster", "num_cities": 2, "num_helpful_votes": 13, "num_reviews": 3, "location": "Crestview, Florida", "id": "71E78B8A388B2EDB9D0CACBDB248C2D7"}, "date_stayed": "November 2011", "offering_id": 283873, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "December 3, 2011", "id": 121364610, "via_mobile": false}

You can walk to the baseball stadium, restaurants, shopping, etc. Also there's an indoor catwalk to the convention center, which is next door.\nThe eateries in/attached to the hotel are good and not over priced.\nThe quality of the rooms and service was what you'd expect from a Hilton.\nOne thing that annoys me to no end is that wifi in the room is $15/device. If the hotel must charge for wifi, why not charge $15 for its use in the room???

Prices were unexpectedly high. My colleague and I had lunch there after our arrival. It cost $90 with tip. The lunch was good but not that good.\nThe 1st floor bar was above average. Every night we were there they featured live music. A jazz trio took requests and were able to play a request of mine. Nice! \nDuring our meeting, the hotel catered the meals. I was impressed with the breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner that were catered by the hotel. Overall the food was above average for selection and execution. I especially liked the poached sea bass that was served for lunch one day. Excellent.\nMazza's (Across the Street): Not affliated with the Four Seasons, but since it's so close I had to comment. We went there after a meeting for a drink. The bartender was surly and clumsy.

The rooms are spacious, comfortable, well furnished and suitable for a business person wanting to work quietly in spare moments outside of the office. The hotel has a restaurant, a bar, a well equipped gym and an outdoor pool. The hotel boasts conference facilities and a ballroom for functions. With our visit coinciding with the Christmas holiday season, we saw several parties take place and there was a festive atmosphere to the place. The elevators were very efficient and we never waited more than a few seconds for one to arrive. The breakfast buffet was very good with freshly cooked omelettes to order. Finally, the staff were simply outstanding; friendly, helpful and full of smiles and willing to go the extra mile to provide good service. Full marks all round for that but now on to the minus points\u2026\nAlthough the lobby area is very large and welcoming, other parts of the hotel look a bit tired and show their age. For example, the dominant colour scheme throughout the hotel appears to be brown. This may have been the standard a few years ago and presumably it's supposed to give the hotel a sober, business atmosphere but to me it felt a bit gloomy. Our room, although very comfortable also showed its age, particularly in the bathroom where some of the fittings seem old fashioned. For example the shower head looked as if it had seen better days and had a low water flow. The lever that switched the water between bath and shower was temperamental and it took me some time to get the shower working properly. The shower curtain seemed dull because it was coloured a light brown in line with the overall theme. Compared to modern business (and even budget) hotels in Europe, the d\u00e9cor in the Omni falls way behind the competition.\nHidden costs: Mrs G and I arrived at the Omni after a stressful arrival at the airport, transit through immigration and a car drive into Houston at peak traffic time. We just wanted to get to our room and relax so opted for valet parking on arrival\u2026 at 24 dollars per night as we discovered later. Self parking is a bit cheaper costing 17 dollars a night. You could argue that secure parking in other US cities (and most major European cities) comes at a similar price but somehow it just seemed excessive. I didn't realise until reading through some of the hints just now on Tripadvisor that free parking is available somewhere around the back of the hotel. Not sure how safe this option would be, especially at night.\nThe major rip off however is the charge for wi-fi access to the internet. More and more hotels (both quality and budget) offer cheap rate or even free internet access but the Omni charges 9.95 dollars per day except there is a catch that isn't obvious or made clear. The charge is actually 9.95 dollars per day per DEVICE. So Mrs G and I had connected with two different laptops plus a smartphone. Three devices at 9.95 per connection\u2026 kerching! To give the hotel some credit, we were able to negate the charges racked up over one week by signing up to a loyalty scheme (more junk mail on the way presumably) but seriously? \nIf my review seems over negative, it's not meant to be. I did enjoy my stay at the Omni and would stay there again, but I'd be interested to see how it compares with other hotels in Houston. Compared to European hotels, the Omni has a lot to learn in terms of general d\u00e9cor and ambience but on the other hand, the Omni could teach European hotels a thing or two about customer service. Overall I enjoyed the stay but those extra charges... ouch!", "author": {"username": "Alan G", "num_cities": 10, "num_helpful_votes": 6, "num_reviews": 21, "num_type_reviews": 11, "id": "9D7C104D55E439F3364DD0550BC99784", "location": "Stavanger, Rogaland, Norway"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 99060, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "December 10, 2012", "id": 147154663, "via_mobile": false}

This Hilton property offers the most comfortable beds and pillows I have found in any of the other area hotels. The bathrooms are spacious and impeccably clean, and always stocked with great amenities. I have to say, the floor staff is willing to find any thing you need be it extra towels to shampoo, and they are always very sweet about. I never feel as if I have inconvenienced them, when I know they are so busy.\nI entertain clients on weekend trips into Houston taking in House of Blues events and miscellaneous activities around Downtown. Our party visits the Hotel about 6 times a year and generally book several rooms at one time. Our stays are consistently perfect. I hadn\u2019t written a review until I happened on trip advisor and read some less than complimentary and inaccurate (imho) reviews. I\u2019ve stayed at many of the Boutique hotels such as the Icon, but continue to come back to the Hilton of the Americas as my first choice. I always seem to be booking multiple rooms, usually a front desk nightmare for most Hotels since arrival times are sometimes different for our party. However, the front desk staff is second to none, very responsive and genuinely friendly. I always feel like both myself and clients are being treated like special guests of the hotel. As soon as you walk, in you are memorized by the stunning, blown-glass sculpture. Nestled through the very large but cozy lobby are sitting areas with free wifi. The bellmen, especially Jerry (hopefully that\u2019s correct), are always incredibly helpful. \nOn our most recent visit, we stayed in what is in my opinion the best room in the place. Parlor Suite 1725/1729 has the most fantastic view with large windows, and is a great set of rooms for entertaining. The room is outfitted with a nice a large table and sitting area where we all enjoy much needed and really great room service after a late night out. Occasionally we stay on the executive level and have always enjoyed the evening reception and morning continental breakfast. Most of the rooms we have personally visited offered an amazing view of Discovery Green park and I believe each floor has a sitting area that overlooks a new park.\nJust a side note, on one of our wedding anniversaries we stayed with the Hilton and we were severed a beautiful cake on the 26th floor terrace to celebrate. It couldn\u2019t have been more lovely and is a very special memory for us. These guys go out of their way to make special moments in guest lives important so it is a great place for a birthday or anniversary. The hotel is also very family friendly even though most think of it as a buisness type destination. There are lots of weekend family activites in the park and the area is very safe. We walk almost everywhere.\nI would like to personally thank Mr. D\u2019Rovencourt and Claudia Robinson for their ever present attention to details and taking such great care in making sure our stays are always perfect.

Having stayed in several Category 5 (and a few 6) I was really curious about what makes a hotel a 7. Additionally, since the Chatwal is in downtown NYC, space is at a premium so I figured it wasn't huge room sizes that make a Category 7 stand out.\nI checked in shortly after 4:00 PM. The Valet handled our luggage and the Butler accompanied us to our room. I thought it was overkill but he explained he needed to show us how to 'use everything' in the room. The first thing that stuck out was that you just wave your keycard over the sensor instead of having to insert it. When they opened the door, I was immediately taken back by the room. There was an excellent view, a really long hallway and it was much roomier than I thought it would be. The room was lightly lit and the beautiful 'wallpaper' was actually made of suede.\nThey walked me over to the bed and showed me the room controller. Everything in the room that was electronic can be controlled by a touchscreen device located on your night stand. Drapes, the shades, lights, temperature were all remotely controlled. You can call room service, have your car brought up automatically, and several other similar things all from the controller. The bed seemed a bid too firm at first and I was a little surprised by it. Yet, after laying in in for just a few minutes I found it quite comfortable and it ended up being the best I've slept in recent memory.\nThey showed us the closet and storage space next. While this seems pretty self-explanatory, there was a lot you could easily overlook if you weren't shown it. That's b/c utilizing space efficiently is taken to an art form at the Chatwal. They showed us each of the closets, how to get in to everything, and a few other assorted niceties like the fold away feature of the desk. There's butler service, shoe polishing service and closets that are not just roomy, but very well organized. Packing and unpacking was made much simpler by the way they had everything laid out.\nHe proceeded to explain the wifi access and how to open the stealth desk and cover (which my wife found amazingly useful for getting ready and putting makeup on ).\nLast up was the bathroom. There were mirrors everywhere which was very convenient when you're getting ready and trying to make sure you can see things from every angle. If you weren't shown that there was a Television in the mirror, I would never have figured it out. The bathtub was huge and had Jacuzzi jets in addition to a 'rain water' shower. My wife raved about the bathtub which I did not try. That's b/c I was too enamored with the shower itself and the rain water faucet is just one of the things we discovered in the hotel room that we'll be equipping our home with.\nThe final item on the bathroom tour was the toilet. It was a very low profile no noise model which was nice, but pretty much what you'd expect in a hotel like this. So I was wondering why it needed explained to me. I quickly realized it was the 'Toto' (I heard about it on the Howard Stern). I'll just leave it at this - Google 'Toto Toilet seat' - as eccentric as it sounds, the wife and I both immediately agreed we'll be getting them for our house. If nothing else, the heated aspect is very comfortable and the images on the control box alone are worth the price of admission.\nAll in all, the service was just amazing. The room was amazing. Everything about the trip was just perfect and i recommend it as highly as I can recommend something. The part I guess that still sort of surprises me is that I am a regular at the W (which is an awesome chain - I mean nothing negative about it at all) and really thought this would just be a slightly more glamorous version with a little more flashy service. I was very wrong and the coolness of the Chatwal can not be overstated.", "author": {"username": "UvalDuvalCuckoo", "num_reviews": 1, "id": "4D80EA785B73101A399B33598CECC189", "location": "Greenville, South Carolina", "num_helpful_votes": 2}, "date_stayed": "May 2012", "offering_id": 1641016, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "May 14, 2012", "id": 129924236, "via_mobile": false}

We arrived at 12 noon, too early to get into the rooms but the staff were very helpful; took our bags, gave us help with restaurant bookings, etc. We came back at around 5.45pm, were given room keys, and told the luggage would be sent straight up. The luggage took nearly 15 minutes to arrive and in fact I was on my way to get it when it arrived at the 3rd floor. I should have just taken it up myself. I then unpacked the things that I needed for 2 days, got into my bathrobe and went to have a shower - only to discover that there was no water. I phoned down to reception to be told how the shower worked. On trying again I then had to phone once again, as there really was no water. Someone was sent up, maybe 10 minutes later - but not a member of the front desk staff - some poor chap who couldn't fix the water and simply had to report back to reception. I phoned AGAIN as I still hadn't heard anything. The man came back with a new room key, but it was unclear as to whether this was my new room or somewhere to have a shower. He said he would move my stuff - but I was still in my bathrobe, due to go out in half an hour, and needed my stuff! So I ended up piling it all into a heap and moving it right then. On getting downstairs to reception I imparted my feelings and, of course, the staff were very apologetic. But my 'rest' time had been wrecked, and I just felt that the whole point of booking into a hotel like this was to avoid exactly this kind of problem. When I got back to my room there was a letter of apology and wine and chocolates, and an invitation to breakfast, which was a very nice gesture, but I'd have rather not have had the hassle.\nGood things - the bar in Triomphe was lovely, and the Lanterns Keep bar is really special. The location is fantastic. The staff are friendly and polite. Not so good - only one lift working, the wi-fi is a bit touch and go, and the rooms were comfortable (especially the bed), but very slightly shabby. The paintwork could do with renewing, and both the rooms I saw were very dark. There was no vanity mirror in the room I was moved to.\nI am aware that I sound extremely fussy, but I'm really not. I often stay in travelodges or similar and am very happy with it - but having splashed out to stay somewhere really speacial, I expected more for the money. I've stayed at 2 other hotels in the 'small luxury' range recently and they were both better experiences.

The room that I chose was not yet available (it was very early) so I shopped for a while. When I returned to the hotel, Gabriel said that the owner of the hotel wanted to meet me. I travel at least 80 days a year and have for several years--I've never met the hotel owner. The owner was charming and lovely and was clearly interested in making sure I had a good stay. My room was lovely--a beautiful upgrade. The experience at the San Carlos was very much like staying at a friend's beautiful apartment. Everything was clean and fresh. The bed and linens were a good quality. The location of the San Carlos is excellent with subway and bus lines within steps. I prefer midtown east--so this location is really perfect. Again, I almost don't want to tell too many people about this as I fear it won't be available the next time I go back.", "author": {"username": "Grommit7", "num_cities": 22, "num_helpful_votes": 84, "num_reviews": 32, "num_type_reviews": 32, "id": "C2B6455AA4BA482F43677250D78A8F50", "location": "St. Louis, MO"}, "date_stayed": "May 2011", "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 4, "date": "May 26, 2011", "id": 109940710, "via_mobile": false}

I wanted to book a more upscale hotel to celebrate a special milestone in our lives, and after careful research online I chose the Eventi (I booked four nights, and a special couples package that was advertised).We arrived pretty late in the night, after a delayed flight into JFK and were ready to relax. Upon check in, I confirmed my package and was pleasantly surprised to hear we were upgraded to a larger room. The woman who checked us in was very nice, but didn't inform us about the hotel in any way. She just gave us our keys, and directed us towards the elevators. Once in the room I was disappointed to see the champagne (that was included in the package, and to be there upon arrival) was not there. I called down, and they sent up the champagne and a fruit plate. The room was everything as promised; modern, clean, welcoming, spacious, and luxe. The bathroom was fantastic, equipped with a combination whirlpool tub and shower. The next morning we received a call asking if we would like to place our breakfast order (included in the package is breakfast in bed) I asked if we could order in tomorrow instead, and they said no problem. The next morning I called to place our order, and the clerk at the front desk informed me that there was no \"note\" on my account regarding a breakfast package. She then put me on hold for about five minutes until she could find the information. Breakfast came up rather quickly, and was decent. The very small issues we encountered on our trip are by no means a deal breaker. I just felt like at the pricey rate per night, you should experience a flawless stay. My only suggestion would be to ensure what's booked is correctly provided, and perhaps review that front desk staff informs all guest equally of the hotels amenities and programs upon check in. All in all, this hotel delivers on everything it promises you.

The rain bath shower is not so great as water leaks out on to the floor because there is only a half glass door with the rest exposed.

I can not compare it to many others, I had a chance to stay at Trump Int only, but I was impressed with the extremely warm and efficient attention from the entire team at Setai. \nWe had a long trip from Europe with a 5 y.o. kid and although I had to wait in line to do check-in (one person was trying to help some guest while another one was typing something on his computer...not a great welcome sign to your guests) and nobody greeted me on arrival except bellboys (huge credits to everyone!) I can not fault our overall experience.\nThe suit I booked through LHW was huge (but no kitchen as mentioned in some other reviews...). It overlooked Fifth Ave and was very clean, large and well appointed. This is so different compare to Trump Int.! But I was not very happy with a fact that there was no bedding prepared for our son (it was clearly stated in my reservation that we are 2 adults and 1 kid) so he slept with us in one bed (we were too tied to spend time solving it on arrival). No special attention to LHW members, no upgrade (but I do not complain as we are not fancy about such things).\nWhat I liked the most was the honesty and clearness in what is offered: in-room refreshments and internet are free and it is made clear to you when you make reservation and it makes you feel like a real guest. I appreciate the honesty of including such details in the price of the room instead of charging you extra for water or anything else (so annoying sometimes). There is no alcohol in the minibar though...I guess you need to order it? There were no instructions on it anywhere...\nHotel's location is somewhat in the middle of nowhere, but you can easily walk to all major sights. It could be a problem for those coming from small towns or those being in NYC for the first time, but we did not find it difficult to walk anywhere.\nFood: Breakfast was absolutely fantastic. In room dining too. I loved the food. BUT, I would expect a bigger choice for vegetarians and those who prefer organic food. They failed to offer us any of the juices I asked for (even water melon...) and I found it strange for a hotel trying to market itself as a 5 star hotel. Could be because hotel does not have its own restaurant but the one being attached to it is servings hotel guests (that is how I understood the concept...). There seem to be some confusion in orders and we had something missing every time we placed an order for in-room dining (we rarely went down to the restaurant for breakfast, etc.). I think restaurant and housekeeping should have some better system on how to cooperate and communicate properly.\nNo issues with housekeeping.\nOverall, this is a very nice property. Great staff.

However, my last stay at the Omni was over three years ago because of an absolutely abysmal experience. But my secretary convinced me that because this one of our corporate choices (which I regularly ignore), that I should at least give it a try again. I succumb to my secretary's logic, but only to be reminded that while the Omni appears to try hard, it's all surface fluff, with significant underlying systematic problems.\nSimply put, after a horrendous stay three years ago, I was allowed to have \"Deja vu all over again\", with another mediocre stay.\nThe Omni started by repeating their error of three years ago. I specifically order a queen or king bed everytime I stay at any hotel. I don't like full size beds, and would rather sleep in a sleeping bag. Three years ago I show up late (because I fly in at the end of the day), with a guaranteed reservation (we'll always charge your credit card .... because we can!) and they claimed they didn't have a king size room (they only have kings and fulls). After telling them point blank that I'd go to another hotel, the \"found\" one room - a king in a basement like area that was dank and damp. It was a horrible stay.\nSo when I arrived on the Thursday before thanksgiving, once again they pull the same stunt. Not even bothering to argue, I simply pulled out my trusted iphone, fired up an app, and had a king reservation less than 2 miles away. But I wanted to be sure that I wouldn't be charged on my card for cancelling because they couldn't fulfill my reservation. That would take finding a manager, which since it was after 11PM, I wasn't terribly thrilled about waiting. However, knowing the Omni's mindset that they could do no wrong, I decided to wait.\nThe manager came and understood why I was cancelling. He was quite nice, and miraculously \"found\" a king room after all. I was tired. I had to leave in less than 7 hours. I decided to stay. -10 points for the bungled reservation and the diffident underling service, +5 for the manager's kindness and service.\nSince I drove, I decided to park in self parking - for which you get the honor to pay a not small sum to enjoy. I forgot that the garage is literally a 1/4 mile away from the elevators and THERE IS NO DIRECT WAY FROM THE PARKING GARAGE TO THE HOTEL THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE YOU TO GO OUTSIDE FOR A VERY LONG PATH. Seriously. Because everyone knows that it never rains in Houston (/sarcasm off), the Omni has there garage without an inside path. But worse, when you're in the garage, you have to either leave from the middle and take this meandering path to the hotel (which requires you to go up and down stairs without any handicapped ramps, great if your dragging a heavy bag), or go back out on the road and either follow the road to the hotel entrance (a good 300 yards), or go by the service entrance and follow a path along the back to come in through the outside restaurant (btw, this is the Omni recommended route - I guess they don't want you to be hit by a car and have the Omni have to fight being responsible). -25 points for the stupidity\nThis abomination is all the more ridiculous because it would be simple to make an exit to the open air parking garage structure where it nearly abuts the Omni, create a bridge over a small culvert and then put you to the back of the building, where an entrance could be easily made. I asked about this three years ago, and I was told \"it's in the plans to be done soon\". Guess what? I asked again - same exact answer. - 25 points for the repeated stupidity\nNow having had all of this remarkable annoyance, the room was perfectly appointed - simply grandly beautiful with every detail. The bathroom is grand, and probably bigger than my first apartment. Note that there is no in room coffee maker. But, when I awoke at 5AM and went down stairs, there was a free open coffee station with Starbucks coffee - very nice detail. I didn't notice if this was still there after the restaurant opened. +10 for thinking of your customer\nMy other quality checks were also precisely met. The internet was fast and free - very nice. +10 The showers water temperature and pressure did not vary - another check for quality. +10 There were no unsightly but slight overlooked problems that can easily be found in most hotels (a screw missing from a fixture, a stain on the carpet, etc.) Everything was perfectly in order. I admire this attention to detail and no how hard it is for a hotel to do this. +10.\nThe breakfast buffet is above average, with the wait staff being very attentive. However, note it's very expensive if not included with your room (~$20)\nSo, once you survive the fight to get to your room, it's a lovely experience - until you have to fight to get back to your car.\nWith just a few simple changes (actually have the rooms you reserve, and fix the &%$#%! path to the garage), the Omni would be a 5 star hotel, set in a beautiful high rise business park. Until then, I'll wait another 3 years to give this another review.", "author": {"username": "GeborenGestern", "num_cities": 12, "num_helpful_votes": 30, "num_reviews": 25, "num_type_reviews": 13, "id": "F5CB50A92AA7A58C18B6FA045194185E", "location": "New Jersey"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 99060, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "November 22, 2012", "id": 145956215, "via_mobile": false}

That said, I had the chance to stay for free after converting some frequent flier miles on a 2nd tier airline into hotel points, and went for it. \n Hotel is renovated and in great shape, and certainly has above-average fittings, decor, and room size. Very courteous staff and a swanky luxury vibe, BUT ....\n Why am I paying $16 to self-park and $9.99 for wifi? And another $16 for a half-liter of bottled water? \n Moreover, I know I was a \"freebie\" guest, or at least low on the revenue spectrum, but they gave me a room that was basically adjacent to a convention meeting room off the 2nd floor lobby, while a conference was going on. Big hint then - don't be shocked when I help myself to the pastries, coffee, and bottled water that are on a serving table 10 feet from my door. \nIt's not that I'm a pilferer or cheap - but when I'm woken up by the sound of dozens of people chatting in the hallway, there should be something in it for me. \n Overall - very good stay, nice hotel, good people, and great location. I'll go back - but only if I get a good deal or if someone else is picking up the tab, as I'm sure there are better deals in that neighborhood.", "author": {"username": "mooshai", "num_cities": 24, "num_helpful_votes": 36, "num_reviews": 65, "num_type_reviews": 41, "id": "E043960761D823EAE13DDD86684BD993", "location": "NY"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 99060, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "November 18, 2012", "id": 145654093, "via_mobile": false}
